Added support for a synthesized bsv file that corresponds to
each awb module and is named with the asim meta-type (%provides name).
All 'imports' should use these files instead of any specific
implementation file names.

This relaxes the restriction that a module implementation file
name must be well known by the parent module.

Fixed up the switch_to_led modules to use this convention.

First cut at new implementation of synthesis boundaries. It doesn't 
work, but neither does it break models with no synthesis boundaries.

Added file missing from last commit.

Okay, so hasim-connect didn't really work (even without a
synthesis boundary). It should now.

Also took advantage of the fact that all bsv implementations 
of an Asim module don't have to have the same filename.

Committing a fairly major change to the HAsim functional partition. This change
encompasses several things:

1) It brings BRAMs up for Bluesim allowing us to run Bluesim models if the software fpgalib is selected.

2) During simulation it loads the program from a .vmh file on disk rather than
from a hardcoded program. This allows us to run benchmarks via the awb interface.

3) The main memory is now a unified memory rather than IMem/DMem. An on-FPGA
cache hierachy should be added later.

Deleting files no longer need in the FPGA lib. Some models will need to be altered.

It seems that MIT was using an Bluespec undocumented syntax that was actually
illegal and is no longer supported by the compiler. Things have been fixed to be
forward- and backward-compatible.

- Added a virtual platform hierarchy that pure bluespec models can now use
  to interact with virtual devices. Basic framework for some sample virtual
  device sets has been added to the virtual platform to assist virtual
  device writers in figuring out where in the hierarchy the device
  implementations should be placed.

- Added a unix-channelio module that encapsulates primitives required for
  a bluespec module to communicate with a UNIX process.

- Added an implementation of the FrontPanel virtual device. This virtual
  device provides a set of virtual LEDs and switches to a bluespec model.
  This particular implementation emulates these LEDs and switches by
  instantiating a hasim-front-panel dialog box and using the channelio
  module.

- Modified the pure-bluespec counter demo example to use the virtual
  platform and FrontPanel virtual device. The current testbench does not
  count anything, but simply loads all inputs into the counter each
  cycle and sends the contents of the counter's latch each cycle to
  the LEDs.

- Added a pure-bluespec multiplier example, which also uses the FrontPanel
  virtual device. The model treats switches 0-1 and 2-3 as two 2-bit
  unsigned integers, multiplies them when the OK button is pressed using
  a shift-and-add multiplier, and displays the result (when available) as
  a 4-bit unsigned integer on the LEDs.

- Modified the "software" FPGA library to use the virtual platform
  infrastructure. HAsim models can now talk to virtual devices via
  connections through the software FPGA library. (Previously, only
  pure Bluespec models were able to use virtual devices).

- Created software versions of the switch2led HAsim APM models.

- Modified the hasim_null_controller to remove references to the
  deprecated TModule identifiers.

- Modified the hasim-configure/Makefile process in order to compile
  and link models using BDPI in a much cleaner fashion. Modules
  with BDPI C files will now need to specify the names of all BDPI
  methods that the C file exports using a %param declaration. These
  names are used my hasim-configure and the Makefiles to locate
  temporary BDPI-specific .ba object files.

- Added an explicit path to lcurses in the BSC command line in order to
  enable the linker to work correctly on Suse 2.6 systems.

- Moved the TopLevel interface definition from hasim_base to hasim_fpgalib.
  Currently, only the software virtual-platform-enabled fpgalib
  implementation has this functionality; therefore, in order to not break
  existing models that are configured with either the non-virtual-platform
  software fpgalib or the XUP fpgalib, the existing hasim_base has not
  been touched. Instead, an alternate hasim_base has been created, which
  does not have the TopLevel definition. All models using the software
  virtual-platform fpgalib must use this alternate hasim_base. Eventually,
  all models will use this new hasim_base.

- Updated the switch2led hasim demos to use the new fpgalib/base
  combination.

- Fixed a minor bug in the hasim top-level Makefile that was generating
  a "rm -f /*.*" command when called with "make clean".

- Added an FPGA Environment (fpgaenv) module hierarchy which is required
  by hasim-common. The module hierarchy underneath fpgaenv comprises of
  the virtual-platform (which has been moved from fpgalib to fpgaenv),
  fpga-components (which contains components such as the BRAM),
  toplevel-wires (magic wires that get mapped to a UCF file), and 
  platform-interface (plumbing code that ties hasim connections to the
  virtual platform).

  Note: fpgalib is now deprecated. In order to maintain temporary
  backwards compatibility, it still exists in the module hierarchy.
  However, to use it, models must use the "deprecated hasim-common" and
  "deprecated hasim-base" modules. In order to ensure compatibility with
  hasim-connect, toplevel_wires is now a dummy requirement for fpgalib.
  Please use the Null toplevel wires module for all fpgalib models.

- Top-level wires have been moved from fpgalib into a separate module
  underneath fpgaenv. Connections.bsv, while instantiating the top level,
  now instantiates a platform-interface (instead of fpgalib). The platform
  interface instantiates the top-level wires and the necessary virtual
  devices, and passes a pointer to the top-level wires module to all
  virtual devices.

- Modified the switch2led demos to use the new fpgaenv.
  Modified the pure bluespec demos to use the new virtual platform and
      top-level wires.
  All other hasim demos continue to use fpgalib (along with the deprecated
      hasim-base and hasim-common modules).

- Added two submodels for fpgaenv, one for Software and the other for XUP
  models.

- Removed two old submodels for hasim-common.

- Updated the switch2led demo configs to adjust for the
  above movement.

have been separated from the "driver" wires (coming from the FPGA
model) by placing them in a sub-interface.

- Added a method to unix-channelio which allows a module
  using the channel to detect if the connected UNIX process
  has exited.

- Added a rule to the graphical front panel which probes the
  above method and terminates the simulation if channelio
  has detected a process exit.

- Fixed a small bug in hasim-connect

Updated the traffic light example to work with the new fpgaenv structure.
To work reasonably in simulation the traffic light delay was made
a paramater and set very short for the software simulation versions.

Updated hasim-connect to include module parameters for the build
of the module at the synthesis boundary.

Hasim and Pure Bluespec models using BDPI will now compile into
vexe and work properly with the iVerilog simulator. However, the
existing iverilog distribution on /proj/vssad will not work, a
development snapshot of iverilog, version 0.9.devel build 2007/04/21
or later is required.

I have a temporary installation of this build set up in my home
directory. If you wish to use this, you need to add
    /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/bin
to your PATH and make sure iverilog, iverilog-vpi and vvp are picked
up from this directory. Also, Makefile.include.template for both
Hasim and pure bluespec models temporarily contains an additional
include path to /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/include. These will be
updated when the new iverilog version is installed in /proj/vssad.

- Updated Makefiles to remove a hard include path to temporarily-
  installed iverilog distribution and instead pick up the path
  from an environment variable created by setup-hasim.

- Added a hack to the Makefiles to work around a bsc compiler
  bug which prevents it from looking for object files in the
  specified directories. The workarounds should be removed
  when the compiler bug is fixed.

1) Local Controller stub is in place. Currently it starts the program via scanchain and returns when done. It
_could_ control the Ports except that the Ports just always say that they are ready and balanced.

2) Makefile now returns 1 correctly if a subdirectory fails. It turns out that the for-loop in the Makefile
was a bash for-loop rather than a Makefile for-loop. This confusion meant that the for-loop returned
"success" [0] even if a child process had failed [1]. We now test for this explicitly and bottom-out
correctly. This might fix some of the weirdness people had experienced at synthesis boundaries with
connections, as these rely on logfiles which might have gotten confused by the incorrect bottoming-out.

More Makefile changes: Now even more intelligent about not recompiling. The insight was that if you do a command like:

all:
      <compile>
      cp file1 file2

Make was taking its cue about success or failure from the cp command rather than the compilation. Should be fixed now.

Store buffer now initializes its BRAMs manually.

Store buffer didnt behave correctly during back-to-back store followed by load, because the store request was still in fifo whereas the load proceeded without looking at the fifo. So I changed
store to hold on to a lock.This makes the model pass all test cases

"pass-through" and "add1". Two models showing off these algorithms.

Some minor changes to hasim_common which converts some previously hard-coded
numbers into AWB parameters.

TBD: add support for multiple FPGA synthesis environments to support FSB flow.

* The store buffer/memstate are a little more parameterized

* The Makefiles are once again more intelligent about exit conditions. It turns
out that "tee" can wreak havoc on exit codes. The use of the BASH "trap" command
and special ${PIPESTATUS} variable now combats that.

- Added an implementation of an RPC-based virtual platform
  infrastructure designed to support hybrid hardware/software module
  development. The software module partitions currently reside
  together with the software RPC stub both in the module hierarchy
  as well as the source tree, but will be moved away later.

- Added an FPGA Environment submodel that conveniently wraps all
  modules required for a consistent hybrid RPC-based platform.

- Added a Hybrid Front Panel virtual device to demonstrate this
  infrastructure.

First pass of Makefile cleanup:
 - Express independence of subdirectory builds as Make rules.
 - Remove separate Netbatch rules.  We can add netbatch back later as a
   special instance of the compiler, not a rule.
 - The model build rules are now target independent.  Building bit, exe
   and vexe differ only at the top level.
 - Each subdirectory has its own .bsc temporary directory to avoid
   potential name clashes.
 - Removed "realclean" rules.  "clean" now removes everything.

Redid synthesis architecture. XUP is supported in the new architecture and
should transparently work like before. UCF and other files are aggregated from

- hasim-bsc-mkdepend computes full dependence graph for source modules
- Build in parallel when possible
- Each subdirectory still has its own build directory but all others
  can now share the results.  Previous check in didn't, forcing lots of
  duplicate builds.
- Directory structure still makes it difficult to compute full dependence
  graph.  Many modules are rebuilt unnecessarily.

Changes to the new functional partition. All tests now pass on the 5-stage timing model.

Benchmarks run between ~9000 and ~66000 model cycles before deadlocking due to a remaining bug in the Store Buffer.

New functional partition should be as mature as existing now.

- Separated the software module source files (for hybrid modules) from
  the software main server (earlier, all software module files were
  residing with the software RRR server code).

- Changed all "*RPC*" names to "*RRR*"

- Added support for service modules to register themselves with the
  RRR server, without the server having explicit knowledge of the set
  of services it is going to host. Currently, we are using a global
  map table of services to accomplish this, but this will be updated
  to a more distributed approach.

- Added a preliminary implementation for building hardware and software
  module trees independently into a hardware target (simulation executable
  or bitfile) and a software target (executable). The AWB build dialog
  box will build the hardware target only. To build the software target,
  do into the build directory and type "make swexe" at a console prompt.

hasim_common reorg. Soft Connections have been separated out and moved into
Bluespec common (soft_connections). Smart Synthesis Boundaries are now a
separate module (smart_synth_boundaries). Modeling constructs are now in
hasim_modellib.

Many deprecated elements of hasim_common have been deleted.

Soft Connections code is better documented and more maintainable.

All demo models have been updated to use the new organization. hasim_common is
now a submodel.

TBD: separate platform_interface from fpgaenv.

Rearranged the Functional Partition to make deprecated modules more obvious.

Added support in the functional partiton for Memory Virtual Device. For now a
"null" cache simply passes all requests on to the memory device.

- added a hasim demo for testing the memory device. The demo
  currently does not build properly; this will be fixed in
  an upcoming commit.

- plugged dangling soft-connections to memory in Platform
  Interface by looping them back in the same module. This
  is a temporary "fix" and will be removed soon.

- added a new module called "ConnectionTerminus" that terminates
  dangling connections. Each connection that can be potentially
  "plugged" (i.e., stubbed-in) by ConnectionTerminus has an
  associated parameter whose value specifies whether the connection
  needs to be plugged or not. The set of connections in this module
  needs to be kept consistent with the complementary set in HAsim
  Platform Interface.

- removed loopback connection stubs from HAsim Platform Interface.

- updated all existing APM models to use the Connection Terminus.
  Parameter values have been set appropriately.

- updated the Hybrid Memory Test model + modules. The model now
  builds and simulates correctly with the updated platform modules.

- Clean up dependence in makefiles.  In particular, "make bit" now knows it
  must first compile the bsv files.
- Remove the logic from hasim-connect that attempted to decide whether to
  rebuild the connection.  The makefiles now fully describe dependence.
  The logic in hasim-connect, while technically correct, caused connection
  files not to be rebuilt sometimes.  The Bluespec compiler then failed
  because of timestamp mismatches on input files.

RRR Service Collection: instead of a global RRR service list, modules
providing RRR services can now specify the set of services they provide
in a distributed manner. Module-local RRR files are all collected by
hasim-configure and concatenated into a master service list, which can be
imported by the server main routine.

Notes:
- currently, the .rrr file within a module must have a unique name, e.g.,
  two modules cannot use the same filename "service-list.rrr". This is not
  a huge issue, but it is an unnecessary restriction since the individual
  .rrr files are read only once by hasim-configure and are not used by the
  build process. Also, unnecessary symlinks to these files are created in
  the build directory.

- currently, only the software side uses this master service list to
  generate service method names and service IDs. The BSV side is still
  hard-coded with service IDs. Adding or removing services (to/from the
  existing front-panel+memory set) will almost certainly break all models.
  This will be fixed soon; until then, please do not add/remove any services!

- the current infrastructure only supports software services. Implementing
  hardware services will require maintaining two separate master service
  lists.

RRR Client Registration: hasim-configure, while recursively
generating the master RRR file, also keeps track of the
sequence number (serviceID) that each service will receive
in the final master sequence. These serviceIDs are printed into
the module's BSV include file as `defines with a macro names
that the module recognizes (derived from the parameter to the
ADD_SERVICE macro calls in the module's .rrr file). The client
thus obtains all serviceIDs it needs to use.

- fixed a small bug in Makefile.top

- slightly changed MemTest: it now displays Hello, World!
  only once and exits. Earlier, it was coded to display the
  message ad-infinitum in a loop because $finish caused the
  hybrid simulation to exit un-cleanly. This has been fixed.

- also updated MemTest to display the message on stderr
  instead of stdout.

  **** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

  Please do not use $display or $write in BSV code henceforth.
  If the module in which this code is used happens to be placed
  inside a hybrid model, then stdout of the simulation
  executable gets plugged into the software executable, and
  the $display strings will confuse the communication protocol.

  Instead, use $fdisplay(stderr, ...) or $fwrite(stderr, ...).

  no longer goes through top level synthesis when not needed.
- Software-side binary is built automatically.
- All module parameters from AWB files are now exposed as potential
  replacement strings during Makefile generation.  Added a parameter
  MAKE_ALL_TARGET to the standard HAsim Makefile.top.template.  The
  paramter defaults to "exe".
- Set MAKE_ALL_TARGET to "bit" for traffic light XUP models.

 HybridSimpleController.bsv Locally Modified          277 

Intermediate checkin towards building support for sending
stats and events to the software partition. The hybrid controller's
code will be in an inconsistent state after this commit, and any
models using it will be broken.

- moved connection terminus from a controller submodule to
  a single file within the hasim platform interface module.

- disabled queuing events in EventController_Simulation. Since
  the main controller is not de-queuing them, pure (non-hybrid)
  simulation models were stalling. This is a temporary fix to
  ensure that the models continue to build and run while a
  cleaner solution is implemented.

- updated connection terminus parameters in config files.

Fixed bug in connection chains. Connection chains are now used more consistently
between stats/events, increasing readability. This also removes the workaround
which was in the hybrid controller.

This is the first step towards abstracting out the interconnection network which
stats/events/commands use to have more alternatives than scanchains.

Events and Stats no longer have separate hybrid/simulation controllers. Instead
the only point of choice is in the controller itself, which is either simulation
or hybrid. This is the first step towrards a hub/ring topology.

- All module parameters that used to be written to module level BSV files
  built by hasim-configure are now written to a file with the BSH suffix.
  Instead of importing interfaces you should instead include the BSH
  file.  From the BSH include you get all the `defines.  The BSH file
  imports the interface.
- Change platform interface to use LED and switch types from the platform.
- Change traffic light to use unsized integer values for writing LEDs.
  The example now works with configurations having 4 or more LEDs.

I finally figured out why my text editor was occaisionally randomly inserting
tabs into the source code, which was then messing up the formatting for everyone
else. I have consequently excised all tabs from the source files, as the start
of moving us towards a unified coding convention.

(The platforms repository is already tab-free.)

Added Waterlevel Ports to Modellib. These have large buffering, then use Stats
to track the maximum number of elements they observe. Then you can go back and
pick optimal buffering for your Ports.

Also a small change in hasim-configure. Cleaned up the surrogates that get
generated initially.

 Assertions.bsv            Locally Added               0 


Added a first pass at assertions. The assertions interface is in place, but uses the scanchain.

Assertions are very "imprecise" in that it may be many FPGA cycles before we
notice an assertion has been raised. Additionally, if more than one assertion is
raised then it is possible that we will report a derivative assertion rather
than the one that was the root cause. There's probably no way to avoid this
without changing the interconnect topology (a longterm project.)

- added support for auto-generating C++ header files for AWB interfaces

- major controller reorganization. There are two primary AWB controllers,
  Null and Standard, and out of these, four new submodels have been created:
  - Hardware-Only Null Controller
  - Hardware-Only Standard Controller
  - Hybrid Null Controller
  - Hybrid Standard Controller

  Of these, the "Hardware-Only Standard Controller" is not fully functional
  (it does not display $display messages correctly during pure simulation).
  Therefore, the old submodel called

  - Simulation-Only Simple Controller (deprecated)
  
  has been retained and is being used by all pure-simulation and
  pure-hardware models until implementation of a dictionary-based streams
  virtual device is complete.

Major change to the build environment.  All C++/H files now are built
in a separate software (sw) tree.  All interface files (dict, rrr) are
built in an iface tree.  The iface tree is built before the hw or
sw trees.

RRR files are now generated dynamically at build time.  Source changes
no longer require reconfiguration.

The sw and iface trees are more Asim-like.  Generated header files must
be included as "asim/provides/foo.h".  The iface is similar.  Dictionary
files are included as "asim/dict/foo.h" or "asim/dict/foo.bsh" and RRR
files are "asim/rrr/foo.h".

The hasim-rrr-stubgen now takes all the source .rrr files and generates
stubs in a single pass.

Added new functional partition verson with macro-op style arrangement. Currently
something is wrong in that the performance is very poor (approximately 24 FPGA
cycles for one model cycle.)

The new partition follows the standardized coding conventions and will enable
MIPS ISA support.

- modified command controller to talk to streams virtual device
- modified memtest to use streams instead of $display
- added fpga->host endSim RRR call to hybrid Starter
- added endSim call to simulation Starter that calls $finish()
- modified command controller to call Starter.endSim() at end
  of simulation (instead of directly calling $finish()).

Put generated Bluespec interface include files in asim/provides tree.

For now you can include these interface files either with the new style:

`include "asim/provides/foo.bsh"

or the old style:

`include "foo.bsh"

This works because both the root of the include tree and the leaf are
on the include search path.  When we are ready we can drop the leaf
from the search path by editing SCons.hw.template.

- renamed command controller to module controller
- re-distributed responsibilities of standard, module,
  event, stat and assertion controllers.
- updated 'starter' module to include a new set of
  command interfaces used by standard controller
- updated MemTest to use dictionaries.
- moved dictionaries from streams into the actual
  subcontroller modules that use them.

Move Bluespec definition of dictionary tokens into compiled bsv files
instead of bsh header files.  Bluespec does type comparison using a combination
of module and type name.  In order to avoid redundant strings the names
of objects in the enumerations no longer have the dictionary name.

No changes for C++ code.

Dictionary types are now specified as DICT_<name>::DICT_<name>, e.g.
DICT_STREAMS::DICT_STREAMS.

Dictionary entries are now: DICT_<name>::<id>, e..g
DICT_STREAMS::STAT_INSTS_COMMITTED.

Dictionaries are now hierarchical.  Dictionary A may have a sub-dictionary
B using the syntax:

   def A.B.FOO "foo string";

Breaking up the dictionary allows modules to define their own sub-dictionaries
of a larger category.  The sub-dictionaries share the same numbering space.
Including the header file at a given level in the tree automatically imports
all definitions below the level.  With this mechanism recompilation due
to dictionary changes can be minimized.

In C++ the name of the printing class changed from DICT_<NAME> to <NAME>_DICT.

In Bluespec the elements are now preprocessor definitions, e.g.
     `define STREAMID_ASSERT 0
The Bluespec ID to string function is now in a module named <NAME>_DICT and
the function is named show<NAME>_DICT.

* Events and Stats and Assertions now use dictionaries.
* Instantiations have been changed to take a dictionary entry.
* Ring numbers are now assigned via a dictionary (RINGID).

TODO: Rings for Events and Stats currently send complete StreamIDs. They should
probably operate on STREAM->EVENT and STREAM->STAT IDs respectively, and their
controllers should "globalize" the names before sending onto the streams device.

Finished update of pure bluespec models to use new fpgaenv.

Added a new module parameter for use at synthesis boundaries, 
"SMART_SYNTH_BOUNDARY". It has a default of true (1) so that 
exisiting code that uses soft connections will continue to work.
But with a value of false (0) no soft connection code will
be generated by hasim-configure. That means that pure bluespec
models with no synthesis boundaries (except at the top level)
will work. There is, however, no support for other synthesis 
boundaries for models that don't use soft connections.

Hasim-configure was updated to respect the SMART_SYNTH_BOUNDARY
parameter described above.

The pure Bluespec 'multiplier' model was updated.

* Added support for load byte/halfword/word in Functional Partition V3.

* Support is done in the functional partition using a read-modify-write loop so
the memory device / cache / store buffer are agnostic to this capabiilty.

* This will be used in the full MIPS ISA.

* Changed Platform Interface to use the new memory virtual device.

 hasim-rrr-stubgen         Locally Modified          343 

Updated hardware RRR service stubs to match slightly modified
Demarshaller interface. The new stubs are also simpler in
functionality because they rely on the Demarshaller's internal
state machine to take care of flow control.

Updated the hasim platform interface to use the front panel
and streams virtual devices with individual arguments
to the remote methods rather than passing a struct as
the only argument.

Also updated the pure Bluespec demos to do the same. Added
a demo that uses both the streams, and front panel devices.
And did a re-arrangement of the bluespec demo models.

- hasim-bsc-mkdepend can now use iverilog as a preprocessor.  bsc is slow because
  it allocates a license each time it runs.  The script still uses bsc if
  iverilog isn't found.

- SCons.top.template now supports the latest Bluespec compiler release.  The
  method for building Bluesim objects keeps changing.  Instead of trying to keep
  up we now use the standard bsc command.  This gives up on some parallelism,
  but the latest compiler can change the C++ optimization level.  I picked -O1
  because the binaries generated are faster by at least as much as the extra
  compilation time.

- SCons.top.template now queries the Bluespec compiler version.  As a result,
  the script remains compatible with older Bluespec releases.

- added support for RRR response path for sw client/hwserver to stubgen.

- changed the manner in which connection-type stubs are generated. The
  monolithic module with all service connections and interface code has
  been done away with. Individual modules are now created for each
  service and placed into independent files (similar to how stubs are
  created for direct method-call stubs). All stub functionalities (i.e.,
  interfacing with the RRR server, creating the de/marshallers, type
  conversions etc.) are inside these modules.

  These modules are then instantiated by a wrapper module
  mkServiceConnections(), which also instantiates the necessary soft
  connections and rules to translate method calls to connection messages.

- changed the naming convention for generated RRR stub files. Filenames
  are no longer generated based on input filename; they are derived from
  the names of the Services as specified in the RRR spec file. (e.g.,
  old = "hybrid-basic-starter.bsh", new = "rrr_service_stub_STARTER.bsh").

- re-organized stubgen code to remove large unreadable code blocks. Also
  got rid of a lot of code that was replicated between connection-style
  and method-style stub generation. 

- updated hybrid basic Starter to use newly available response path for
  the DumpStats method (previously, it was using the hw->sw RRR client
  to send the response).

Moved the pure Bluespec model foundations into the same
directory as the Hasim model foundations so they can 
share the build scripts. 

Fixed up the pure Bluespec models to use the moved
model modules.

These models still don't build because of the new
hasim-module.{h,cpp} files used by some fpgaenv modules.
The problem is that hasim-module lives in the controller, 
which isn't used in pure Bluespec models.

* Events now use RRR instead of streams.
* Events-controller is now a hybrid hardware/software module.
* Event instantiations should be updated to use the correct dictionary.
* Events now take "event name" strings at instantiation rather than a message.

* Rearranged Controllers to the new organization. There are now only 3 controllers:
     * Hybrid Standard
     * Hybrid Null
     * Hardware-Only Null
* Split HAsim Model into Hybrid and Hardware-only models.
* Removed some obsolete models.
* Reconfigured all models to use the new model/controller/fpgaenv organization. 
* This organization should now be consistent: Hybrid everywhere or HW-only everywhere.

Still Ongoing:
* Refactor modellib into local controllers.
* Rename model files to be more consistent.

Updated pure-bluespec main to new global arguments format.

Moved platforms-module to low-level-platforms-interface. (Again it should really
be a library.)

TODO: Global Arguments should be part of a library once we support it, rather
than in main.h.

Version 3 of the Functional Partition now supports an isa-emulator service via
RRR.

Upon encountering an emulated instruction, the current value of all registers is
passed to the software via the RRR syncRegister() call. Then a call to
emulateInstruction() is made. The software makes one or more calls to
updateRegister(), and finally a call to emulationFinished(). (This last call
will eventually be replaced with an ACK.)

Removed some exraneous instantiations from the controller.

- Teach the scons software-side builder to link with m5.  m5 sources aren't
  configured as part of the model.  Instead, m5 is built as part of the
  configure/make step in checking out an ISA-specific repository.  The
  model build step knows to link with m5 when a magic parameter is set.
- main() passes command line parameters to the virtual platform (m5).
  This will need to be more intelligent to pass the right subset of parameters.

Time for HAsim software build environment to grow up:
  - Honor command line DEBUG/OPT and workspace default in awb.config.
  - Use %library and %include directives from config files
  - We now build with libasim and libdral.
  - We don't yet use asim/syntax.h, but should soon.

- main() now parses an argument (--funcp="<arg>") to a separate argument
  vector and passes it to the functional platform.  The --benchmark
  parameter is gone.

- All benchmarks (smips and alpha) are now set up by a single script

- Alpha/m5 simulation now loads a standard Alpha binary and returns control
  to HAsim.

- The benchmark run scripts now take a --gdb argument.  The script invokes
  gdb and passes all the necessary commands to run a benchmark.

- Stubgen completely restructured, but no additional functionality
  is visible yet. All existing models should behave exactly as
  before.

- Changed naming conventions for generated RRR files. All "rrr_"
  prefixes are unnecessary (since all generated files are anyway
  in an rrr/ directory) and have been removed.

- The term "service stub" is ambiguous since a service has a
  server component and a client component. All server-side stubs
  are now called "server_stub_<servicename>". Client stubs will
  be called "client_stub_<servicename>" once this functionality
  is enabled. All generated stub filenames now reflect this
  nomenclature.

- Updated module BSV files to include the renamed stubs.

I believe there was a type in regstate_manager_macro_ops.bsv, line 987.
I also changed the ISA_REG_INDEX to a bit-vector type because it uses maxBound, and is used in array indexing, both of which can't be done easily with tagged unions. I will be changing the return type of getIsaSrc and getIsaDst to return Bits instead.

- added support for hardware-side Client stub printing
  and automatic generation of client connections (not
  fully tested).

- added a null entry to the ASSERTIONS dictionary to
  enable demo hybrid models to build correctly.

- changed some more incorrect "...service..." names
  to "...server...".

- Separate memory into two categories.  Functional model memory now is defined
  under the functional model.  The memory defined in the FPGA environment
  is now just scratchpad memory.  Either memory may be hybrid.
- Hybrid functional memory is two components:  communication with the host and
  memory management.  Separate the two.  VMH is defined as a manager.  Soon
  m5 will be, too.
- Put isa_emulator in hasim_funcp.  hasim_funcp now requires hasim_isa_semantics.
  If the ISA semantics are hybrid then a hybrid isa_emulator may be chosen under
  semantics.

- Fix sw side preprocessor definitions for 32-bit Linux.  Resulted in wrong
  definition of UINT64.
- Add support for standard Asim TRACE
- hasim-dict generated the wrong code when there was exactly one object in
  the dictionary and the object was in a sub-dictionary.
- Fix the printing of errors in the events controller.

- Break apart hybrid functional memory into two clean pieces.  One handles RRR
  and the other handles simulated memory.  There is a clean interface to
  simulated memory so VMH could be replaced by m5 with no changes to the RRR
  code.
- The simulated memory interface now supports accesses of any size.  The RRR
  code still uses on 32 bit references.  That part will need to change.

- modified Funcp Memory to behave as an RRR service talking to
  the platform via auto-generated connections (instead of a
  virtual device). This breaks Funcp v2.

- generalized Funcp Memory to support multiple address and data
  widths. The widths can be changed now by simply modifying the
  AWB parameters.

- changed name of links between FuncpMemory and MemstateCache
  to "funcp_memory..." instead of "vdev_memory...".

- modified Platform Interface to translate calls to scratchpad
  memory instead of funcp memory.

- retained the temporary include for funcp_memory.bsh in Platform
  Interface. This is required for the connection types to be
  visible at Platform Interface, which instantiates the auto-
  generated connections module. This causes all non-SMIPS
  HAsim models to break (they were already broken before this
  check in). This will be fixed soon.

  - Add "EVENTS=1" to the awb.config file in your workspace
  - Add "EVENTS=1" to the build command line

The build command line overrides the value from the workspace.

- Generalize the argc/argv building code and promote --bluesimargs to
  an argc/argv pair.
- Invoke bluesim with execvp()
- Add --funcp-prefix and --funcp-suffix options to the run script for specifying
  options to m5.

NOTE:  The run script may strip quotation marks around the bluesimargs option.
       From a shell you probably need to use: ./run --bluesimargs=\"-V elvis\"

Tired of redundant sizes sprinkled through the functional partition
configurations.  Created one, top level, "funcp_base_types" requirement.
Files in the base types must be terminal within the functional partition.
For now defined here is the ISA address size and the integer register
size.  From these other parts of the functional partition pick sizes
for funcp_memory and isa_emulator.  The only remaining other place where
a size is needed is the memory_store_info_size in funcp_memory, due to
temporary RRR limitations.  The sw side of the memory interface verifies
that memory_store_info_size is set correctly.

Also changed the protocol for ISA emulator to return a branch.  Using
the high bit caused problems since we can't know where the high bit is
without assuming a PC size.  Since the branch bit as part of the returned
PC is a temporary hack I used bits 1:0, which must be 0 for both Alpha and
MIPS.  Of the 4 states, 0 is no branch, 1 is branch, 2 is unused and 3
means terminate.  The exit status is in bit 2 for terminate.

Compute the array sizes for cross-synthesis-boundary soft connections
at compile time instead of using large static arrays using a two pass
compilation scheme.  Only early phases of the compiler are used for the
first pass to avoid wasting time.

Reducing the array sizes saves 70% of the Xilinx Xst (synthesis) time
for the smips 5 stage model.  Down to 50 minutes.  There is still room
for improvement!

The maximum array sizes (100) are now defined in the wrapper template
created by hasim-configure.  Bluespec gets slow beyond about 100,
otherwise there is no reason it has to be so low.

- Break apart ISA emulation into two components:  one to handle RRR that
  is simulator independent and an ISA emulator implementation that is
  simulator (e.g. m5) dependent.
- Defined a NULL emulator implementation that forces a failed exit in the
  hardware if called.

- Priority hacks in RRR stub generation:
  - Force Bluespec scheduler to give priority to methods in order of method
    number.  (Low number == highest priority)
  - Force a service named FUNCP_MEMORY to be service ID 0.  The priority tree
    for favors services sorted by ID.  This gives memory the highest priority.
    We can now be sure in an unpiplined timing model that all memory stores
    for earlier cycles complete before an ISA emulation request is transmitted
    to software.  We can still make no guarantees for pipelined timing models.

- Run script puts quotation marks back around arguments when needed so

  of adding shell escapes.
- Merge help messages from run script and model using a hidden switch to
  the model.

- Updated implementation and UI for connection-based stubs. These RRR
  services now generate the following 3 entities:

  - a regular client/server stub that talks to the RRR stack. This stub
    uses packed-Bit#() types, and so does not need to include the definitions
    of any abstract RRR types.

  - a set of connections and rules as part of HAsim Platform Interface
    (in client_connections.bsh and server_connections.bsh), which also use
    packed-Bit#() types, thereby avoiding any include requirements.

  - a "remote" client/serve stub that uses the abstract types specified in the
    RRR spec file. Since this remote stub is going to be instantiated by the
    end-user module that "owns" these abstract types, it has access to them.
    Internally, this stub talks to the remote end of the connection(s) and
    performs the pack/unpack.

  Note that the remote end-user module must now include "remote_client_stub_XXX"
  instead of "client_stub_XXX", but the actual Bluespec interface and module names
  do not need any prefix, e.g., ClientStub_XXX <- mkClientStub_XXX();

  Services still use multiple connections for their various methods, but this
  can now be changed internally without impacting the end-user modules' syntax.

- Updated regstate manager and hybrid starter to use the new remote stubs.

- Removed unnecessary `includes from HAsimPlatformInterface.bsv. HAsim Demo models
  should now work, but haven't been tested yet.

- Added a couple of params to isa-emulator.awb to explicitly specify the
  bit-widths of aggregated RRR types.

Fixes to get simpler non-model designs running. Major change
was adding %library directive for libasim into bluespec_common.
This, unfortunately, is an unnecessary dependency for non-hybrid
models, so probably should change, either by moving the %library
directive or creating hybrid and non-hybrid versions of the
bluespec_common module. Also added non-functional support for
switches needed by the platform. We still need to modularize
switch processing better.

Created a separate module for command line switch processing. That
module is used by main and %required by the hybrid controllers. A
controller was added to the pure bluespec models so they can share the
switch parsing. Those models are currently using the full hasim switch
parser, which is overkill but works. 

Moved the %library specification of libasim to hasim_common to match
the convention in the the pure bluespec designs.

Added a  regression run for the base hasim package. This benchmark
currently builds but does not run properly.

Switched the null benchmark to use the standard setup-bmark
script and modified that script to handle the 'none' feeder
and the run.bmark script to create a fake stats file for that
feeder as well.

Now the 'hello world' hybrid demo runs and passes as a 
regression. So in your asimrc file one can test the hasim,
hasim-alpha, and hasim-mips package with the lines:

[regression.launcher]
PACKAGES=hasim,hasim-alpha,hasim-mips

Cope with the fact that m5 uses mysql if it exists and doesn't
if it doesn't. So we need to conditionally link in mysqlclient.a.

I think we should figure out a way to get all this meta-logic out of

- Make stdout and stderr line buffered.  LEDs and error messages now
  come out when you'd expect.
- Enhance showfp switch.  Now takes arguments:  gui, stdout and none.
  Null benchmark defaults to stdout.  Others default to none.  Logic
  controlled mostly in run.bmark.

- I have changed the size of the offset to 3 bits instead of 2, and
  parametrized it in the process, so the number 3 actually comes from
  log(`FUNCP_ISA_INT_REG_SIZE/8). (8 is hardcoded, because 8 bits make a byte,
  and that's not really going to change :) )

- There was another (minor) bug: the tag was defined to have (64-8) bits, when
  it should have been (64-8-2) bits. Fixed that.

- I have added a soft-connection funcp_invalidate_all from
  mkFUNCP_RegStateManager to mkFUNCP_Cache. Whenever the reg-state decides to
  emulate an instruction, it sends an invalidate_all request to the cache. Not
  sure, if this should be routed through the mem-state instead.

- Currently, this blocks all future cache requests, and does not bypass them.

- I am still not sure how we sync (or plan to sync) all memory operations
  right before an instruction needs to be ISA-emulated; so I am just assuming
  that there will not be any pending requests in the cache/memory hierarchy
  when this invalidate is received. In other words, invalidation can start
  immediately and does not need to be blocked by anything. Also, it seems that
  the current cache can be invalidated on a per-line basis already via a
  soft-connection "funcp_invalidate" from mkFUNCP_Memory in
  memory/hybrid/hybrid-funcp-memory.bsv, and this invalidation is also not
  blocked on anything.

- Use a pseuty TTY for logging stdout/stderr in run.bmark.  This causes
  both the timing model and Bluesim to use line buffered output.

- Dynamic parameters now work in both hardware and software.  Parameters
  are derived from awb --dynamic params.  Software parameters are just like
  Asim.  Only integer parameters are supported in hardware.  At the beginning
  of a run the software side streams all dynamic parameters through a ring
  in the hardware.  Declare parameters in Bluespec with:

    `include "asim/provides/hasim_modellib.bsh"
    `include "asim/dict/PARAMS_<module>.bsh"
    ...
    Param#(<bits>) param <- mkDynamicParameter(`PARAMS_<module>_<param name>);

  Notes:
    - <bits> may be up to 64 bits
    - <module> and <param name> should be all capital letters
    - The Param interface has a _read method so you can get a parameter value
      just by using the object name.  There is intentionally no write method.

Get rid of the warnings about conflicting writes to the prfValids vector
by adding an execution_order pragma.  According to Bluespec this does not
affect the scheduler.  It only affects the priority encoder for outputs
of a cycle.  When the warning is printed the compiler picks a priority
anyway, so there is no problem using the pragma.  There is a longer
discussion at http://bluespec.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=281

Increased size of functional partition cacheline. Previously it was set
to be equal to the word-size. The `FUNCP_CACHLINE_BITS parameter
indicates the size of the unctional partition cacheline in bits. Since
this value must be known external to the cache as well, the parameter is
defined in hybrid-funcp-memory.awb.

With cachelines bigger than words, a store sent to the cache that misses
must be translated into a load to memory.

The valid bits of the cache were not explicitly initialized to zero; fixed.

Passes hello and memory_tests_aligned in bluesim.

- Scan out statistics from HW frequently enough to avoid overflow.  Sum them
  on the software side and emit at the end of a run.  Scan out happens while
  the simulation remains live.
- Change stats file format to a compromise between machine readable (CSV) and
  human readable.
- Add --cycles option to stop simulation after some number of cycles.  (Will
  stop after the first heartbeat is received > requested cycle.)

  common any more.  Thought about building a base class and deriving from
  it, but that was even more work.

Marked the cycle passage with A-ports as discussed with Nikhil. Basically the module looks like this:

  1(enq)    1(deq)
   --->     <---
      ------
        | | |
      ------
   <---
 0(notFull)

The numbers are the A-ports latency. Currently the 0 latency A-ports are not there, but they must be added if we want to have non-zero latency credits.

- Enable model ID detection in run.bmark to avoid reloading FPGA when it already
  has the right bitfile.  Just reset.
- hasim_model.bsv now holds reset signal for 128 cycles.  Probably overkill.
- Scoreboard didn't recover from reset properly due to test for live tokens
  reading uninitialized values without checking an "allocated" flag.
- Clean up functional direct mapped cache.

- Clean up some bugs keeping the models from compiling after Murali's BRAM
  check-in.

* Update the regstate manager to drain its pipelines before any invalidate or
  fast rewind.

* Slow rewinds are still unimplemented, but now cause an assertion failure. We
  think we know how to do slow rewinds.

* This now allows the 5-stage model to pass all Alpha bechmarks in simulation.

- Speed up compilation by taking the ring write out of the assertions predicate
  test.  Testing an assertion now conditionally writes a register.  Another rule
  copies the register to the assertions ring.  This appears to speed up
  compilation.

- hasim-configure now does an unlink() of a destination before writing a
  generated file.  This should avoid writing through a link and overwriting
  sources when a source file has the same name as an AWB interface.  It also
  should complain when such a name class exists and exit.  Untested.

- Add set-associative cache functional cache.  There are two dynamic parameters:
   ENABLE_FUNCP_MEM_CACHE:
     0: Cache disabled.  All requests bypass cache and go directly to memory.
     1: Cache enabled.

   FUNCP_MEM_CACHE_WRITE_BACK:
     0: Write back.  Stores flushed on victimization.
     1: Write through.  Stores write to memory directly and cache dirty bits
        are never set.

- Add done signal for flushing from cache to regstate manager to guarantee
  all dirty lines are flushed before hybrid instruction emulation begins.

- Print a warning when using --tr command line switch and TRACE is disabled.

- Clean up emulation control signals to the functional cache

- Add a functional TLB through which all loads and stores now pass.  Two
  versions are available:  one that maps directly from VA to PA.  Another
  is a hybrid version.  m5 now uses the hybrid version and all addresses
  going through RRR are physical.  Translation is currently private to the
  functional model, but we can change that.  A few notes:

  - The current implementation of the TLB is pretty poor.  Just 8 entries
    in LUTs and a one entry victim buffer.  It is big and has too many
    misses.  That's just a local policy, though.  Slowdown isn't typically
    huge and I'll fix it soon.
  - Using physical addresses will let us avoid invalidating the cache on
    emulated instructions.  That's next week's work.
  - For stores, a hit in the TLB takes no extra time in the functional
    model.  For fetches and loads there is a quick path that checks a small
    cache in LUTs for which there is no penalty.  There is a one stage
    bubble waiting for the full TLB before issuing the load in a longer path.

- split software stack into two threads: a Monitor/Service thread and a
  System thread. The Monitor/Service thread monitors the hw/sw channel
  and calls service methods if required. The System thread executes the
  software side's primary application. The two threads are spawned by
  the Controller. If the System thread terminates, the software process
  will exit.

  All "pure" Bluespec hybrid models now need to define a
  BLUESPEC_SYSTEM_CLASS as part of the System AWB module. This might not
  be a good idea since some simple systems (e.g. counter demo) used to be
  agnostic to whether they were being built into a hybrid or standalone
  model.

  HAsim systems currently get around this requirement by using a hack:
  all top-level Controllers define a base SYSTEM_CLASS which simply blocks
  on a pthread condition variable that never gets signaled, thereby
  preserving the existing behavior of HAsim models.

- added a pure Bluespec RRR test/benchmark model.

- Fix a couple of address alignment bugs in TLB quick path calls from regstate mgr.

- Register state manager no longer invalidates caches before ISA emulation.
  It is the emulator's responsibility to invalidate on write or just flush
  dirty lines on read during software-side emulation.  There is an RRR method
  for invalidating the whole cache for clueless software emulators.

  Note:  invalidate all as a sw -> hw service is not well tested since no ISA
  emulator currently uses it.

- Improve heartbeat info. printing.

  hashTo32() takes an arbitrary number of bits as input and yields a 32 bit
  hash.  It is safe to truncate the resulting hash to any size.

More careful separation of virtual and physical address sizes.  MEM_ADDRESS
is passed between HW and SW through RRR as 64 bits, independent of the size
of a physical address inside the FPGA.  This lets us choose physical address
sizes between 32 and 64 bits.

- Split TLB into separate ITLB and DTLB.
- Change TLB soft connection to the one upon which we agreed.  No takes a tuple
  of token and address.  Kept quickTranslateVA() method to avoid modifying
  regstate manager interface, but we'll drop the method after regstate manager
  changes.
- Rename option to turn off cache FUNCP_MEM_CACHE_ENABLE so it gets sorted
  with other cache options.
- Software-side statistics receiver now confirms that a statistic appears at
  most once in the hardware.

- Implement slow rewind.  Moved register freelist pointer from snapshot
  to regstate manager, since it is needed for fast snapshot-based rewinds
  and slow rewinds.
- Add a module that holds just interface classes for communication between
  timing models and the functional partition (interface/funcp-timing-interface.bsv).
  Instead of passing tuples we will start to pass structs so fields can be
  added without having to modify all timing models.
- Add mkRegFileInitialized() and mkRegFileFullInitialized.  Same interface
  as standard Bluespec types but initializes the RegFile before first use.
- Fix off-by-one error in command line parsing of quoted arguments that have
  escapes.  This was breaking mcf and any other benchmark with command line
  arguments.

- Dictionary builder now puts module ID in high bits and entry ID in low bits
  so entries that are nearby lexically are also nearby numerically.
- Modify assertions so each module has a single node on the assertions ring,
  with the goal of simplifying the routing.

- Snapshot token valid bit was never cleared, resulting in some probability
  of triggering fast rewind from stale data instead of slow rewind.
- Change dynamic parameter ring to use fewer stops using the same method
  as for assertions.  Each module now allocates one node on the ring.

- added support for multiple-argument RRR calls. The type system remains
  unchanged, so all types in a multi-arg call must be known by the module
  that instantiates the stubs.

  makeRequest() and sendResponse() methods take a list of arguments, as in
      makeRequest_STATS(statID, value);

  acceptRequest() and getResponse() methods return a struct, from which the
  individual args can be extracted, as in
      let req <- acceptRequest_FOO();
      // req.uid, req.value are the call's arguments

- updated PARAMS controller and STATS controller to take advantage of multiple
  arguments. Several RRR services still do not exploit this.

Modified the hasim build scripts to allow multiple AWB files to declare BDPI imported functions. The original technique was to use %param  BDPI_NAMES as a magic parameter that would cause the correct list of .ba files to be known to the SConscript. Now, we can use any identifier that _begins_ with the string BDPI_NAMES, and the values get appended.

Top level mkModel now instantiates a clock generator to feed the full hasim
system. %param MODEL_CLOCK_FREQ is used to set the frequency at which the
model would run. Only certain frequencies are legal, and if you use one that
is not, then the bluespec compilation will bail out. (This functionality is
brought to you by fpga-components.)

- added support for generating C++ server stubs.

- updated all services to use auto-generated stubs. Please see these examples
  if you want to write new software servers.

  The ISA emulator and FUNCP_memory use fancy types, and therefore use a
  backdoor to directly talk to the RRR server monitor (instead of using its
  stub). Look at their C++ code to figure out how to exploit the backdoor.

- removed all hand-generated RRR links, rules, optional connection endpoints,
  and params from HAsimPlatformInterface.bsv and ConnectionTerminus.bsv. All
  RRR links are now automatically generated. Only translations for virtual
  devices remain in Platform Interface (as they should).

General Code Cleanup:

* Updated DebugFile to HAsim coding conventions
* RegState/MemState now use DebugFile

* Updated functional partition to use new BRAM interface.

* Removed spurious provisos, replaced with typedefs. IE TOKEN_INDEX_SIZE, ISA_NUM_REGS

* Replaced ad-hoc Wires with Counters.

Store Buffer:

* Since the new store buffer is buggy, restored the old store buffers.
* The models still use the new store buffer until further notice.
* Removed unused Utils file in store buffer.
* Switched non-standard May# type to equivalent existing type Maybe#

* Reclaim functional partition tokens more aggressively after a rewind. This
stops the ooo from running out of tokens for now. However we don't expect it to
pass the benchmarks because it's still getting exceptions from bad-path
instructions.

TODO: Spec and implement a real exception interface from the functional
partition.

- Unify the soft connections between the register state manager and the
  memory state manager.  Separate channels for load, store and commit allowed
  reordering of store and commit requests passed to the store before.
  This was the cause of the 0x2aaaa... addresses sent to m5.  0x2aaa... is
  the Bluespec uninitialized value.

- Improve debug messages in the store buffer.

Beginning of code cleanup.
  * Move hasim_common and friends into modules/hasim/util
  * Add copyright notices to a bunch of files.
  * Change filenames to new coding convention.
  * Fixed a bogus dependency in store buffer.
  * No more bypassed soft connections, which were unused, but imposed a requirement.
  * Removed some deprecated modules.

To do: merge modellib and hasim_common, since we use stats and stuff everywhere now.

- Add a new cache module to hasim_common:  HASIM_TINY_CACHE.  Tiny cache takes a
  parameter for the number of entries (power of 2).  On lookup all entries
  are checked and the result is returned in the same cycle.  Updates are to
  the LRU entry.
- Functional TLB now uses a two level cache.  Level one is a private
  HASIM_TINY_CACHE.  The ITLB and DTLB for a single core share an L2 built
  from a HASIM_CACHE.  Sizes were picked by running the test input of SPEC2k
  gcc and the first four billion instructions of a SPEC2k Perl reference run.
  Since there will be separate functional TLBs for each core we want to keep
  them as small as possible.  Sizes were chosen at a point where simulation
  speed was no longer affected by TLB size.  Currently they are 2 entry L1 ITLB,
  4 entry L1 DTLB and 64 entry shared L2 (16 sets x 4 way set associative).
- Double the size of the functional memory cache to 64KB.

- Add poison bit to scoreboard.  Raise an assertion causing the simulator to
  abort on attempts to execute a poisoned instruction.
- Set poison bit for illegal instructions.
- Move interface data structure declarations for talking to the ALU here
  so they aren't replicated in each ISA definition.
- Add new options to run script for dumping to a VCD file for use in a
  waveform viewer.  (--vcdstart and --vcdcycles)

- Token:
  - Add LIVE_TOKEN_INDEX, which is 1 bit smaller than TOKEN_INDEX.  The token
    index space is 2x the number of tokens that may be live at any time so we
    can compute whether one token is older than another.
  - Add a function, liveTokenIdx(), for converting from TOKEN_INDEX to LIVE_TOKEN_INDEX.
  - Add wrapper methods for allocated BRAM and LUTRAM arrays that have
    NUM_LIVE_TOKENS elements but are indexed by a TOKEN_INDEX.  This avoids
    having to call the conversion function explicitly on every access.
  - Clean up age cmmparison function with names making it obvious which argument
    is which.

- Drop snapIDs from snapshot.  Maybe it served a purpose some time in the past.
  All it does now is force unpredictable errors.

- New store buffer (all old ones removed):
  - Manages one pool of entries and is willing to accept a compile-time specified
    number of stores per token (automatically -- no explicit store numbering).
  - Store buffer is invoked as method calls, not soft connections.  Lookups with
    empty hash chains (the majority) waste no time waiting for the store buffer
    and head straight for the cache.
  - Store buffer has two modes, controlled by param MEMSTATE_SBUFFER_OOO_MEM.  In
    the current default mode (0), the store buffer hits in the first address match
    without considering token age.  This is appropriate for in-order models.
    The OOO mode (1) finds the token with the best age match among more than one
    address match.  Allowing for mode 0 keeps the store buffer from hiding bugs
    in an in-order timing model.
  - Memory state manager defines named structs for communication with register
    state manager.
  - debugLog output of memory state manager and store buffer are combined into a
    single file.

- Protect a few more connections in the register state manager in case a timing
  model passes in a dead token.

- Add a hashTo8() function for times when 8 or fewer hash bits are needed.  The
  Bluespec optimizer doesn't drop unused high bits quickly enough during optimization
  and can be dramatically slower using hashTo32().

- Huge surprise:  Setting place & route effort to HIGH instead of STD is much
  faster!  Alpha superscalar OOO model par drops from over 4 hours to 40 minutes!
  FPGA resource usage and timing are nearly identical.
- Use LIVE_TOKEN_INDEX sized BRAM arrays instead of TOKEN_INDEX for all but
  the alloc vector.
- Simplify logic that computes the new alloc vector for fast rewind.  Now
  uses tokenIsOlderOrEq() method which tests one bit of a subtract for each
  alloc bit.  Old test was a function of 5 comparisons per bit.
- Functional TLB honors uncacheable response from hybrid VtoP.
- Correct off-by-one errors in register free list debug messages.
- Code I deleted last time from snapshot logic was necessary, but not optimal.
  Replaced it with a simpler scheme for determining whether a snapshot is still
  valid that updates a single TOKEN_INDEX instead of an entire NUM_TOKENS sized
  bit vector.

- Add assertion to confirm that all instructions were drained properly before
  instruction emulation begins.  Required a small change to the oldest token
  logic in the scoreboard.  Before this check-in the oldest token logic was
  sometimes inaccurate for the instruction immediately following a rewind.

- Remove SCons directive requesting M5 signatures for determining what to build.
  The syntax changed for later SCons versions and M5 signatures are the default
  anyway.

  - Add accessor functions for individual epoch fields.
  - Remove unused functional scratchpad struct.
  - *** Epoch values now set by functional model.  No need to set or track
        epoch in timing model front end. ***

- Add fault interface to functional model for poison bit handling.  Current
  faults are:  illegal instruction (abort) and page not mapped.  Page not mapped
  fault maps a new page, rewinds to just before the faulting instruction and
  returns a restart PC.

- Restructured functional TLB interface to return fault on page not mapped.
  Previous behavior was always to map a new page, even for speculative instructions
  that turned out to be bad path.  This caused m5 to run out of memory.

- Added helper functions to return low level connection names in Connections.bsv
  in an effort to promote cross module send/receive in functional/timing message
  passing.

- Heartbeat on SW side now triggers an error and exits if no instructions commit
  during a heartbeat interval.

Looks more complicated than it is:

- Move Alias#() to HAsim common so it can be used by other modules.

- Add an ALU test harness.  Just a simple test that reads in a data stream,
  invokes some function, and writes data back.  Function could be plug-and-play
  but this is just a test and the user is likely to just replace a rule or
  two and not check in.

- Restructure directories with a tests tree.

- Add a random data workload to drive the test.

- Add switches to Xilinx map and par command lines to work harder to reach
  timing goals.  Now map runs longer but par is faster.
- New script hasim-xilinx-summary is invoked at the end of a build.  In addition
  to the summary it also writes timing error status to a control file.  The
  run script now checks the file and refuses to load bit files with timing
  violations.  (--force-load overrides the error.)
- Change assertions code to reduce the work done in the cycle an assertion
  is raised.
- Add respNotEmpty() / reqNotEmpty() methods to Connection_Client/Server
  interfaces.
- Some changes to the register state manager to improve timing:
  - Stop using initialized BRAM, since each reference reads a predicate.
  - Break scoreboard fault state into multiple single bits to avoid write
    contention between rules.
  - Add new COUNTER_Z interface and mkCounter_Z.  A COUNTER_Z is the same as
    a normal counter but has an isZero method.  isZero is set when a counter
    is updated, so predicates based on the counter just test a single bit.
  - Move regstate manager "state" object into a module.  Interface exports
    "readyToBegin" and "readyToContinue" methods.  These methods resolve to
    single bits that are computed when the state is updated.  Like COUNTER_Z
    the goal is to reduce predicate latency.
  - Slight refactoring of rewind pipeline.

Split the register state manager, which had grown to 3500 lines, into separate
files.  Individual functional/timing interface pipelines are in files named
regmgr-macro-pipe-<interface>.  This first commit generates equivalent Verilog
to the previous version.  All global state that used to be at the top of the
large file is now declared in regmgr-macro.bsv and passed in to the constructor
for each pipeline.

The next step will be to reduce the global state and relax inter-pipeline
scheduling constraints.  Simplifying the schedule will, hopefully,
allow for higher FPGA frequencies.

Initial check-in of the Shared Tree physical interconnect.

Current progress:
* Stations with unlimited local sends/recvs.
* Functions for automatically generating routing tables for the stations.
* Verified complex topology including 31 sends/recvs in bluesim.
  (tests will be checked in after integrating with Streams for on-FPGA testing.)
* Logical one-to-many is working.

Limitations:
* Not yet integrated with soft connections/module collect.
  User will have to manually instantiate station and give it list of connected sends/recvs.
* Logical many-to-one not yet implemented.
* No model uses these yet (waiting on many-to-one, more verification.)

Next steps:.
* Create test case using virtual platforms so we can run a long test on FPGA 
  to convince ourselves the network is deadlock-free.
* Replace assertion stations, which are currently manually instantiated anyway.

Start to define interfaces for shared structures in the register state manager.
Each of these modules offers independent interfaces to each pipeline stage.
The modules then prioritize and handle requests from all pipeline stages.

Three added with this check-in:
  - TLB connection
  - Memory connection
  - Physical register file.  The valid bits are now encapsulated within the
    PRF module.  The most complicated interface is getResults.  For getResults
    the PRF request interface takes a vector of all inputs to an instruction
    and returns a vector of the corresponding values.  The current implementation
    uses a dual ported BRAM to satisfy the request faster, but that decision
    is now completely contained inside the PRF module.  The getResults pipeline
    is also much simpler as a result.

Added a new global state module for regstate.  It currently holds the scoreboard,
global FSM state and register state assertions.  I tried having separate assertion
nodes for each regstate pipeline, but that caused designs that used to build
correctly for our Xilinx FPGAs to start failing.

- Route source register input values directly from the register file to the
  ISA datapath instead of routing back through the getResults pipeline.  This
  saves a cycle and reduces the logic.
- Balance a few pipelines for timing:
  - Moved work in emulation pipeline in getResults -- no cycle change
  - Add a cycle to getDependencies.  The pipeline is relatively short, so
    shouldn't affect run-time.

- Add a quick path one cycle faster (and fully pipelined) for the special
  case that all register sources are ready and can be read in the first cycle
  of reading a vector.

* Added a streams-based test case for the physical interconnect. 

* This will eventually allows us to run on the FPGA for a long time and convince
ourselves that the network does not deadlock.

* Currently the testcase has exposed a deadlock. The physical station needs to be changed to resolve this.

* Misc bugfixes in physical station.

- Pass whether load is instruction or data down to functional cache.
- Add single line functional L1 instruction and data caches.  A hit in the L1
  cache saves 4 FPGA cycles.  L1 caches are coherent.
- Functional memory manager now checks store buffer and cache in parallel.  Since
  most loads miss in the store buffer this generally saves an FPGA cycle and
  simplifies the pipeline.
- Add special case module for single entry tiny cache.  Uses same interface as
  the general one.  Needed special case since LRU doesn't have to be maintained.
- Add inval() method to tiny caches.

Latest BSC compiler adds output directory to path search list and complains if
output directory was already on the path.  SCons script now deals with the
annoying compiler difference (checking version number).

- Reduce Bluespec license warning time to 7 days.
- Replace BRAM test module with much more extensive tests.  Tests latency and
  throughput for varying sizes.  Also checks for lost read requests due to
  multiple read requests with delays for corresponding retrieval of the results.
  Validates loaded values, too.  BRAM test can also drive Bluespec's BRAM
  implementation.
- Remove memAddress and isStore from the ISA datapath response.  They can be
  computed from other sources.
- Add new COUNTER interface and mkLCounter module that supports calling
  up and down methods in the same cycle.  Bluespec's mkCounter does not!
  Replaced all users of counters.
- Fixed a race in the store buffer rewind code that could cause a deadlock.
- Fixed a race in the memory state manager that could cause loads to see
  the wrong value when run in parallel with a store being committed.  Never
  actually saw it happen.

- Reduce connection width from 400 to 320 bits, the size of the largest
  connection.  (Functional cache to RRR memory service.)

- Dramatic reduction in store buffer rewind latency.  Most often the store
  buffer is empty and no work needs to be done.  Other times, the youngest store
  is nowhere near the youngest token.  One counter and a hint register can
  eliminate the majority of slogging through tokens looking for stores to
  remove.

  have space.
- Split a pipeline stage in the cache module.  It was the longest path.

Drop LUT combining (-lc auto) argument from Xilinx map.  The default is "off"
and, it appears, we should use the default.  LUT combining tries to use LUTs
densely by packing unrelated logic into a LUT.  While this does reduce hardware
usage, it appears that the result is also increased pressure on routing and
more complicated fan-out.  This can sometimes cause par to fail completely.

- Eliminate most of the compiler warning messages from the register state manager.

- Change default FPGA speed to 75MHz.

- Major change:  eliminate register snapshots for rewind.  After some
  experimenting it became clear that snapshots require a lot of FPGA area but
  don't provide that much of a performance boost during rewind.  Memory for snapshots
  would have to grow with the number of contexts simulated, so they become less
  and less attractive.

  - Simplify the getDependence pipeline.  Eliminate rules in the main pipeline
    to handle multiple destinations by moving the extra work out to support
    modules.  E.g. Physical register free list now returns the right number
    of registers for the token all at once instead of one register at a time.
  - Move architectural to physical register map to a module.  The same module
    also records rewind information for each token.  The module arbitrates
    access to the register map for all pipeline stages, eliminating some
    rule scheduling spaghetti.
  - Instruction emulation must now recover the register mapping appropriate
    for an emulated instruction using rewind data.
  - Add youngestDecoded() to the scoreboard.  Rewind now begins at this token
    instead at the youngest token, since only decoded tokens affect the
    architectural to physical register map.

- Delete no longer used snapshot module.
- Move scoreboard and physical register free list modules to register-data/data
  library.
- Fixed some of the compiler warnings in functional cache.  In the process
  noticed and fixed some race conditions that we haven't seen in testing.
  Most egregious was the possibility of a sequence:
     (1) LOAD [a]
     (2) STORE [a] <- x
  possibly winding up with the value loaded in (1) in the L1 cache even after
  store (2) due to differences in load vs. store pipelines.  Changed the
  protocol to reserve the L1 value as the load enters the pipeline and only
  update with the true value if the L1 still holds the reservation.

- Moved FPGA clock frequency specification to platforms.
- SCons script changes:
  - Add Xilinx cost table support.  The cost table set in the model configuration
    can be overridden on the scons command line (COST_TABLE=<x>).
  - Add "xst" target alias, mostly useful for writing scripts that share a
    common build through xst and then try multiple cost tables in parallel for
    map and par.

Add context ID to the token.  TOKEN_INDEX is now a struct with two fields:
context ID and token ID.  Very little code had to change because most indexing
with TOKEN_INDEX is done through the mkLiveToken... storage classes.

Significant changes are still required in the register state scoreboard.
Most of the data structures now support multiple contexts.  However, the
interfaces to key routines (e.g. token allocation) don't talk about context
ID.  Only context 0 may be active, for now.

Virtual to physical register mapping is not yet aware of the context ID.

- Starter enables contexts.  The message is passed along a chain and ultimately
  ends at local controllers.  Timing models may ask local controllers whether
  a context is active.
- To do: end multiple context run gracefully.  Right now the simulation will
  stop when the first context says it is done.
- Functional interface for requesting a new token is now aware of contexts.
- Register state scoreboard is now aware of contexts.
- Move debug log files to hasim_debug subdirectory in each benchmark.

- Map table now supports multiple contexts and is stored in BRAM.  The table
  is indexed by context, so the entire map table for a given context is
  available in a single cycle.
- The start-up interaction between the physical register free list and the map
  table is not yet worked out.  For now all contexts begin mapped to the same
  physical registers.  Clearly this won't work.
- Store buffer now supports multiple contexts.  To be a hit, context ID must
  match in addition to the address.
- Bug in hasim-cache caused ways with data to be favored as victims over ways
  with no data.  Cache was thus typically 75% empty.

- Add upBy() and downBy() methods to counters to support modifying the value by
  something other than 1.  Counters support one call to the pair up/upBy and
  one call to the pair down/downBy per FPGA cycle.
- Add record_next_cycle method to debug log to support code where the simulated
  cycle is incremented in a rule and you want debug messages for the same rule
  to reflect the updated cycle.  Normally the update to the simulated cycle
  would not be visible until the next FPGA cycle.  Sometimes this method avoids

- Functional TLB now supports multiple contexts.  Each context has private
  L1 data and instruction TLBs.  All contexts share an L2 TLB, though the
  index includes the context id, so there is no actual sharing.
- Define CONTEXT_ID RRR types so context ID can be shared with software.
  This includes a major hack in funcp-base-types.h to use the C preprocessor
  to define the RRR append methods for sending contexts to hardware.
  The goal was to limit the hacks to a small set of modules.  Most code
  sees real type names.  
- Use Bluespec structs down all the way to the lowest level of the RRR memory.

* Maptable now initialized for multiple contexts.
  AR 0 of context 0 -> PR 0
  AR N of context 0 -> PR N
  AR 0 of context 1 -> PR N+1
  etc
* Freelist starts in right position to account for these registers being allocated.
* Freelist now has only one "rollback" method, freeRegs. rewindToToken uses this
method to free the destinations of a killed token.
* Simplified commitResults pipeline since multiple commits are handled by freelist internally.
* Fixed a potential PR leak in getDependencies on junk tokens.
* Passes regression tests, but have not yet tried on FPGA.

- Add backing store metadata type to HAsim cache interface.  The metadata isn't
  stored in the cache.  If a cache request causes a reference to the backing
  storage, the metadata is passed along with the backing storage request.
  This is a clean way to pass the context ID through a cache reference or
  the allocate on fault bit, in the case of the TLB.

- Pass context ID through hybrid memory interface out to the software simulator.

- Clean up the hybrid memory RRR interface, taking advantage of the new
  ability to use multiple parameters.

  to the compiler which bits may change.
- Number of physical registers is now an AWB parameter (global).
- Changed functional TLB cache and memory cache size specifiers to a number of
  bits in the index, since the sizes must be powers of 2.  Also made them global.
- Change the FMR computation for the all contexts summary.  Made the divisor the
  total cycles simulated across all contexts.
- Removed some old AWB size specifications for RRR parameters that are no longer
  needed.

Compiling the memstate synthesis boundary was becoming unacceptably slow.
Break it up by:
  - Adding a memstate-base-types module to hold the interface types to the
    rest of the functional partition.
  - Add synthesis boundaries around the TLB and functional memory caches.
    They already had one module each with no methods, so the change was
    easy except for having to move typedefs to memstate-base-types.

The TLB compilation is still quite slow as the number of context IDs increases,
though not as bad as before.  Will address that later.

The Bluespec compiler's scheduler appears to have exponential compile-time
performance degradation when doing a lookup on a vector of 4-way tiny caches.
Clearly this can be generalized, and Ravi at Bluespec is working on that.
In the mean time the computed scheduler predicates can be radically simplified
for some rules using the conservative_implicit_conditions pragma.  This pragma
simplifies the predicate by, among other things, requiring that all input and
output FIFOs be ready even if they are accessed conditionally in the rule.

The specific changes:
  - Use conservative_implicit_conditions in both the HAsim cache code and in
    the TLB cache.  Some rules in the TLB had to be split in order to avoid
    deadlocks.
  - Change build script to generate Bluespec scheduler dump (.sched files)
    when building wrappers.

Simplification of predicates for just these 6 rules reduced the LUT usage of
the unpiplined model by 3% with no changes in timing and reduced compile time
of the TLB synthesis boundary by about 90%.

Various changes to improve Bluespec scheduling:
  - Use LUTRAM when appropriate instead of Vector.
  - Tag some rules with conservative_implicit_conditions
  - Break some rules apart.

Changes save another 2% of registers and 1% of LUTs.  Required fan-out to
meet timing appears to have decreased, too.  The Unpipelined model is down
to 86% occupied slices from 90%.

- New SCOREBOARD_FIFO interface in common (mkScoreboardFIFO).  Scoreboard FIFO
  returns a slot ID on enq() and has a separate setValue() method for setting
  the value.  Data still flows out in the order enq() is called but the values
  may arrive out of order.  first() and deq() block until data arrives for the
  head entry.
- Use the scoreboard FIFO to allow functional memory to return results out
  of order while maintaining the appearance of order within individual queues
  defined in regstate-connect-memory.  This breaks the memory connection between
  functional getInstruction, doLoads and doSpeculativeStores.  Memory can now
  return out of order results for the store buffer and the L1 functional caches.
  For now, the L2 functional cache still handles one reference at a time.
- All memory requests have an associated FUNCP_MEMREF_TOKEN used to determine
  the proper scoreboard slot.

Stall only the context requesting an exception (fault or branch misprediction)
instead of stalling all functional pipelines.  Note that because pipelines
return results in order if the timing model sends a request for the faulting
context the pipeline will stall.  Not well tested, since the unpipelined
model has no branch mispredictions.  Faults do appear to work with multiple
contexts, suggesting that branch misprediction will too.

Changes:
  - Fix interference for shared register state BRAMs in exception and emulation
    pipelines.
  - Stop passing entire multi-read-port BRAMs to pipelines that just read.
    Pass the interface for a single read port that the pipeline may
    assume belongs to it.  Now all the pipeline assignments are in the top
    level regmgr-macro.bsv.
  - Individual pipelines no longer store their FSM state in global state that
    controls state.readyToBegin().  FSM state is private to a pipeline.  Global
    state may block a pipeline from starting for specific contexts during
    exception and instruction emulation processing.  state.readyToBegin takes
    a context id.
  - Branch and fault epochs are now per-context.
  - Scoreboard pipeline occupancy counters are now per-context instead of global.
  - Scoreboard canEmulate() and canRewind() methods take a context id.
  - Clean up the map table pipelines to avoid interference between request
    enq() and deq().
  - Add live token versions of the new pseudo multi-read-port BRAM.

* Added a first draft of the FIR filter tutorial under docs/tutorials.
* Added a SW-only FIR filter and a HW-only FIR filter.
* The tutorial involves fusing these two into a Hybrid model using RRR.

TODO: Add a benchmark .cfg file so people don't have to setup the benchmark manually.

- Improve hashing code:
  - Add generic hashBits() function that takes n-bits as input and produces
    an n-bit hash using the best available hashing function for the size.
  - Add more CRC-based hashing functions for 8, 16 and 24 bit inputs.

- Add COUNTING_FILTER interface and a variety of implementations:
  - Provides a mkCountingFilter module that tries to pick the best filter for
    the set size.  Uses direct decode filters for small sets, decode filters
    with shared entries for medium sizes, and Bloom filters for large sets.
  - Decode filters map one or more elements of the input space to one bit
    in the filter.
  - Bloom filters use 4 hashes.

- Add a filter to the HASIM_CACHE implementation.  It doesn't do anything now
  but waste space.  In the future it will be used to allow multiple cache
  references in flight but allowing only one reference per set to simplify
  the cache implementation.  At current sizes the functional TLB cache uses
  a decode filter and the functional memory cache uses a Bloom filter.

Another step toward allowing the HASIM_CACHE implementation to return results
OOO.  Read responses used to be just the data.  Now read responses include
the original address and caller-defined metadata associated with the read
request.  With this there will be no need for a ROB to associate details
about read requests with the read data coming from the cache.

- New "extends" module from Bluespec can do an extend or truncate with no added
  provisos.  Use carefully, since error messages about size mismatch are delayed
  late enough in the compilation that it becomes hard to correlate errors to a
  source line.

- Added new memory heap package.  Memory heaps manage a single data type and
  provide malloc, free and data access methods.  There are two memory heap
  interfaces:  one for single-cycle data (e.g. LUTRAM) and one for multi-cycle
  data (e.g. BRAM or hybrid memory).  The actual storage is passed as an
  argument to the heap manager, so it can manage anything.  A few basic storage
  classes are also defined including LUTRAM and BRAM as well as convenience
  modules that both allocate storage and instantiate a heap for the storage.

- Use memory heap for pending writes to the cache so the data and mask, which
  can be quite large, don't have to be replicated in pipelines flowing through
  the cache.

* Changes to support multi-context inorder model.

* The local module controller now returns the next model cycle to simulate. For
  now it goes in round-robin ordering.

* A-ports now properly report their full/empty status, which the local
  controller uses to determine if a module can proceed for a certain context.
  Soft connection Sends have a new notFull() method to support this.

* A-ports and stall ports now take a context ID as a parameter to enq/deq.

* Redid the stall-port interface to canEnq/doEnq/noEnq &
  canDeq/peek/doDeq/noDeq.

* Events/Stats now have multi-context versions. Stats software controller dumps
  a stat for each active context. TODO: The event controller should do the same.
  For now events are disabled.

* Stats/Dynamic params are moved from modellib to hasim_common in order to break
  the dependence in the functional partition. Modellib is now timing-model only.
  All changes in the functional partition are related to this - no new
  functionality was necessary.

- Add inverse versions of the hash functions and add support for more hash sizes.

- Cache changes:
  - Pipeline hasim-cache.  Remove the FSM blocking rules except for the state
    that invalidates the entire cache, which we never use.
  - Only one operation may be active on a given set, but hits may be serviced
    while a miss is outstanding to a different set.
  - Add the concept of cache words in addition to lines.
  - Cache writes are now word sized instead of line sized.  For functional
    memory this reduced the data being passed to 64 bits from 512 bits (line
    plus bit mask).
  - Reudce tag size by using inverse hash functions to recover address from
    tag + set id instead of using the full address as a tag.

- Switch to BRAM scoreboard FIFOs in the register state connection to memory
  and add many more buckets to permit a lot of parallel memory operations.

- Remove mkBypassFIFO from fifos.bsv.  Use the Bluespec library version instead.

- Fix/improve scoreboard FIFOs.

- Fix BRAM version of memory heap.

- Add word-level valid bits to each line in the set associative cache.
  Writes that miss in the cache set the word valid bits and do not trigger
  a fill of the whole line.  When a dirty line is evicted the valid bits
  mask which words get stored to memory.  Performance in regions with lots
  of stores is dramatically improved, since the line is unlocked immediately
  after the first store instead of waiting for a fill to return.
  Performance appears not to be affected significantly in other regions.
- Widen maximum soft connection data width for cache line store word mask.
  (Cache line store is the widest message).
- A few tweaks to iverilog build rules.  Still doesn't build without adding
  links in the build directory to some C modules in the tree.  I think that's
  a Bluespec wrapper bug.

The cache policy change makes a timing bug in RRR more likely.  RRR methods
within a service are not guaranteed to be ordered.  This can allow a
load and a store to be reordered before reaching the memory service.
Angshuman is working on that.

- hasim-configure now treats public BSH files as include files instead of as
  imported Bluespec libraries.  BSH files are included by the synthesized
  header instead of being imported in the synthesized BSV file.

- Add a hack to hasim-configure to work around the lack of `if in the Bluespec
  preprocessor.  When an awb parameter is 0, hasim-configure adds a second
  definition using the name with a _Z suffix (e.g. LOCAL_MEM_USE_LINES_Z).
  Conditional code can then check `ifdef LOCAL_MEM_USE_LINES_Z as a test for
  zero/nonzero.
- Add a `define with the number of entries at each level of a dictionary.
- Change the platform interface to export one port to the scratchpad memory
  for every dictionary entry in VDEV.SCRATCH.
- Wrap the data passed from a model to scratchpad memory in method calls at
  each end.  The end points no longer know that the message is passed through
  a soft connection.  Using this interface a cache could be inserted
  without the knowledge of the end points.
- Update mem-test to use the new scratchpad interface.

- Improve the memory test.  It now uses three scratchpads that are accessed
  through the packed memory interface.  One maps a single object to
  multiple scratchpad words.  One maps one object to one word.  Another
  maps multiple objects to a scrathpad word.  Reads test for errors
  and a final pass does a quick pipelined read performance test.

- Break the hybrid null controller into two different configurations:
  - The "basic" controller requires a central controller.  The basic central
    controller requires support for dynamic parameters and assertions.
  - The "pure Bluespec" controller does not require a central controller.

- Scratchpad memory now supports an index that is smaller than the entire
  scratchpad.  The size of the index is reported automatically during
  run-time initialization so the scratchpad manager can map multiple
  scratchpad regions into memory.

- Add a predicate to dynamic parameters making them unreadable until after
  they have been set by the host.

Move creation of the marshalling container to the platform scratchpad module.
Since the virtual platform's scratchpad word size may vary by physical
platform it is always a good idea to use the marshalling wrapper, which
adds no latency cost when the container size matches the data size.

Building a scratchpad in normal code is now a single module constructor
call using standard memory interface arguments.

- commitStores now checks whether the token or the token's alias is live and,
  if it is, triggers an assertion.  A live token indicates the store token
  lived long enough that the token or token alias was allocated before the
  store token was dropped by the timing model.  This new check depends on
  the timing model calling commitResults for a store before calling commitStores.

- Put back the assertion removed a few days ago in the store buffer.  Change
  the error message to note that the token's alias could cause a problem, though
  that is now unlikely since the commitStores assertion above will fire first.

When simulating count cycles and print a message, including the cycle number,
when an assertion is triggered.  Finally this should give us a way to
figure out exactly when an assertion happens.

 CPP.pm                    Locally Modified          610 

C++ RRR server code can now choose to include only the definitions of
the aggregated input and output types for its methods. To do this,
define the macro TYPES_ONLY before including the server stub header,
and undefine the macro immediately after the include. Subsequent
un-gated includes of the stub header will automatically avoid
re-defining the types.

Example usage in a C++ server definition:

#define TYPES_ONLY
#include "asim/rrr/server_stub_FOO.h"
#undef TYPES_ONLY

class FOO_SERVER_CLASS
{
    ...
    ...
};

#include "asim/rrr/server_stub_FOO.h"

When a module defined in awb has only .bsh files treat it as include-only.  Do
not build a .bsv wrapper and do not add the module name to the set of wrappers
to compile.

* Epochs were no longer being used by the functional partition 
  (which now has a more general exception mechanism). They have been removed and are a timing
  model-only construct now.

* tokIsOlderOrEq now takes TOKEN_ID rather than TOKEN_INDEX.

Dynamic parameters enable or disable the local cache and control whether it is a
write-through or write-back cache.  These parameters are mainly useful for
debugging on real FPGA hardware, as they force more memory state to be visible
to the host software.

- Interface changes to set-associative cache in RL library.
- Set associative cache no longer supports full cache invalidate.  It was never
  used and becoming too complicated.
