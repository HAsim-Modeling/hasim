Added support for a synthesized bsv file that corresponds to
each awb module and is named with the asim meta-type (%provides name).
All 'imports' should use these files instead of any specific
implementation file names.

This relaxes the restriction that a module implementation file
name must be well known by the parent module.

Fixed up the switch_to_led modules to use this convention.

First cut at new implementation of synthesis boundaries. It doesn't 
work, but neither does it break models with no synthesis boundaries.

Added file missing from last commit.

Okay, so hasim-connect didn't really work (even without a
synthesis boundary). It should now.

Also took advantage of the fact that all bsv implementations 
of an Asim module don't have to have the same filename.

Committing a fairly major change to the HAsim functional partition. This change
encompasses several things:

1) It brings BRAMs up for Bluesim allowing us to run Bluesim models if the software fpgalib is selected.

2) During simulation it loads the program from a .vmh file on disk rather than
from a hardcoded program. This allows us to run benchmarks via the awb interface.

3) The main memory is now a unified memory rather than IMem/DMem. An on-FPGA
cache hierachy should be added later.

Deleting files no longer need in the FPGA lib. Some models will need to be altered.

It seems that MIT was using an Bluespec undocumented syntax that was actually
illegal and is no longer supported by the compiler. Things have been fixed to be
forward- and backward-compatible.

- Added a virtual platform hierarchy that pure bluespec models can now use
  to interact with virtual devices. Basic framework for some sample virtual
  device sets has been added to the virtual platform to assist virtual
  device writers in figuring out where in the hierarchy the device
  implementations should be placed.

- Added a unix-channelio module that encapsulates primitives required for
  a bluespec module to communicate with a UNIX process.

- Added an implementation of the FrontPanel virtual device. This virtual
  device provides a set of virtual LEDs and switches to a bluespec model.
  This particular implementation emulates these LEDs and switches by
  instantiating a hasim-front-panel dialog box and using the channelio
  module.

- Modified the pure-bluespec counter demo example to use the virtual
  platform and FrontPanel virtual device. The current testbench does not
  count anything, but simply loads all inputs into the counter each
  cycle and sends the contents of the counter's latch each cycle to
  the LEDs.

- Added a pure-bluespec multiplier example, which also uses the FrontPanel
  virtual device. The model treats switches 0-1 and 2-3 as two 2-bit
  unsigned integers, multiplies them when the OK button is pressed using
  a shift-and-add multiplier, and displays the result (when available) as
  a 4-bit unsigned integer on the LEDs.

- Modified the "software" FPGA library to use the virtual platform
  infrastructure. HAsim models can now talk to virtual devices via
  connections through the software FPGA library. (Previously, only
  pure Bluespec models were able to use virtual devices).

- Created software versions of the switch2led HAsim APM models.

- Modified the hasim_null_controller to remove references to the
  deprecated TModule identifiers.

- Modified the hasim-configure/Makefile process in order to compile
  and link models using BDPI in a much cleaner fashion. Modules
  with BDPI C files will now need to specify the names of all BDPI
  methods that the C file exports using a %param declaration. These
  names are used my hasim-configure and the Makefiles to locate
  temporary BDPI-specific .ba object files.

- Added an explicit path to lcurses in the BSC command line in order to
  enable the linker to work correctly on Suse 2.6 systems.

- Moved the TopLevel interface definition from hasim_base to hasim_fpgalib.
  Currently, only the software virtual-platform-enabled fpgalib
  implementation has this functionality; therefore, in order to not break
  existing models that are configured with either the non-virtual-platform
  software fpgalib or the XUP fpgalib, the existing hasim_base has not
  been touched. Instead, an alternate hasim_base has been created, which
  does not have the TopLevel definition. All models using the software
  virtual-platform fpgalib must use this alternate hasim_base. Eventually,
  all models will use this new hasim_base.

- Updated the switch2led hasim demos to use the new fpgalib/base
  combination.

- Fixed a minor bug in the hasim top-level Makefile that was generating
  a "rm -f /*.*" command when called with "make clean".

- Added an FPGA Environment (fpgaenv) module hierarchy which is required
  by hasim-common. The module hierarchy underneath fpgaenv comprises of
  the virtual-platform (which has been moved from fpgalib to fpgaenv),
  fpga-components (which contains components such as the BRAM),
  toplevel-wires (magic wires that get mapped to a UCF file), and 
  platform-interface (plumbing code that ties hasim connections to the
  virtual platform).

  Note: fpgalib is now deprecated. In order to maintain temporary
  backwards compatibility, it still exists in the module hierarchy.
  However, to use it, models must use the "deprecated hasim-common" and
  "deprecated hasim-base" modules. In order to ensure compatibility with
  hasim-connect, toplevel_wires is now a dummy requirement for fpgalib.
  Please use the Null toplevel wires module for all fpgalib models.

- Top-level wires have been moved from fpgalib into a separate module
  underneath fpgaenv. Connections.bsv, while instantiating the top level,
  now instantiates a platform-interface (instead of fpgalib). The platform
  interface instantiates the top-level wires and the necessary virtual
  devices, and passes a pointer to the top-level wires module to all
  virtual devices.

- Modified the switch2led demos to use the new fpgaenv.
  Modified the pure bluespec demos to use the new virtual platform and
      top-level wires.
  All other hasim demos continue to use fpgalib (along with the deprecated
      hasim-base and hasim-common modules).

- Added two submodels for fpgaenv, one for Software and the other for XUP
  models.

- Removed two old submodels for hasim-common.

- Updated the switch2led demo configs to adjust for the
  above movement.

have been separated from the "driver" wires (coming from the FPGA
model) by placing them in a sub-interface.

- Added a method to unix-channelio which allows a module
  using the channel to detect if the connected UNIX process
  has exited.

- Added a rule to the graphical front panel which probes the
  above method and terminates the simulation if channelio
  has detected a process exit.

- Fixed a small bug in hasim-connect

Updated the traffic light example to work with the new fpgaenv structure.
To work reasonably in simulation the traffic light delay was made
a paramater and set very short for the software simulation versions.

Updated hasim-connect to include module parameters for the build
of the module at the synthesis boundary.

Hasim and Pure Bluespec models using BDPI will now compile into
vexe and work properly with the iVerilog simulator. However, the
existing iverilog distribution on /proj/vssad will not work, a
development snapshot of iverilog, version 0.9.devel build 2007/04/21
or later is required.

I have a temporary installation of this build set up in my home
directory. If you wish to use this, you need to add
    /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/bin
to your PATH and make sure iverilog, iverilog-vpi and vvp are picked
up from this directory. Also, Makefile.include.template for both
Hasim and pure bluespec models temporarily contains an additional
include path to /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/include. These will be
updated when the new iverilog version is installed in /proj/vssad.

- Updated Makefiles to remove a hard include path to temporarily-
  installed iverilog distribution and instead pick up the path
  from an environment variable created by setup-hasim.

- Added a hack to the Makefiles to work around a bsc compiler
  bug which prevents it from looking for object files in the
  specified directories. The workarounds should be removed
  when the compiler bug is fixed.

1) Local Controller stub is in place. Currently it starts the program via scanchain and returns when done. It
_could_ control the Ports except that the Ports just always say that they are ready and balanced.

2) Makefile now returns 1 correctly if a subdirectory fails. It turns out that the for-loop in the Makefile
was a bash for-loop rather than a Makefile for-loop. This confusion meant that the for-loop returned
"success" [0] even if a child process had failed [1]. We now test for this explicitly and bottom-out
correctly. This might fix some of the weirdness people had experienced at synthesis boundaries with
connections, as these rely on logfiles which might have gotten confused by the incorrect bottoming-out.

More Makefile changes: Now even more intelligent about not recompiling. The insight was that if you do a command like:

all:
      <compile>
      cp file1 file2

Make was taking its cue about success or failure from the cp command rather than the compilation. Should be fixed now.

Store buffer now initializes its BRAMs manually.

Store buffer didnt behave correctly during back-to-back store followed by load, because the store request was still in fifo whereas the load proceeded without looking at the fifo. So I changed
store to hold on to a lock.This makes the model pass all test cases

"pass-through" and "add1". Two models showing off these algorithms.

Some minor changes to hasim_common which converts some previously hard-coded
numbers into AWB parameters.

TBD: add support for multiple FPGA synthesis environments to support FSB flow.

* The store buffer/memstate are a little more parameterized

* The Makefiles are once again more intelligent about exit conditions. It turns
out that "tee" can wreak havoc on exit codes. The use of the BASH "trap" command
and special ${PIPESTATUS} variable now combats that.

- Added an implementation of an RPC-based virtual platform
  infrastructure designed to support hybrid hardware/software module
  development. The software module partitions currently reside
  together with the software RPC stub both in the module hierarchy
  as well as the source tree, but will be moved away later.

- Added an FPGA Environment submodel that conveniently wraps all
  modules required for a consistent hybrid RPC-based platform.

- Added a Hybrid Front Panel virtual device to demonstrate this
  infrastructure.

First pass of Makefile cleanup:
 - Express independence of subdirectory builds as Make rules.
 - Remove separate Netbatch rules.  We can add netbatch back later as a
   special instance of the compiler, not a rule.
 - The model build rules are now target independent.  Building bit, exe
   and vexe differ only at the top level.
 - Each subdirectory has its own .bsc temporary directory to avoid
   potential name clashes.
 - Removed "realclean" rules.  "clean" now removes everything.

Redid synthesis architecture. XUP is supported in the new architecture and
should transparently work like before. UCF and other files are aggregated from

- hasim-bsc-mkdepend computes full dependence graph for source modules
- Build in parallel when possible
- Each subdirectory still has its own build directory but all others
  can now share the results.  Previous check in didn't, forcing lots of
  duplicate builds.
- Directory structure still makes it difficult to compute full dependence
  graph.  Many modules are rebuilt unnecessarily.

Changes to the new functional partition. All tests now pass on the 5-stage timing model.

Benchmarks run between ~9000 and ~66000 model cycles before deadlocking due to a remaining bug in the Store Buffer.

New functional partition should be as mature as existing now.

- Separated the software module source files (for hybrid modules) from
  the software main server (earlier, all software module files were
  residing with the software RRR server code).

- Changed all "*RPC*" names to "*RRR*"

- Added support for service modules to register themselves with the
  RRR server, without the server having explicit knowledge of the set
  of services it is going to host. Currently, we are using a global
  map table of services to accomplish this, but this will be updated
  to a more distributed approach.

- Added a preliminary implementation for building hardware and software
  module trees independently into a hardware target (simulation executable
  or bitfile) and a software target (executable). The AWB build dialog
  box will build the hardware target only. To build the software target,
  do into the build directory and type "make swexe" at a console prompt.

hasim_common reorg. Soft Connections have been separated out and moved into
Bluespec common (soft_connections). Smart Synthesis Boundaries are now a
separate module (smart_synth_boundaries). Modeling constructs are now in
hasim_modellib.

Many deprecated elements of hasim_common have been deleted.

Soft Connections code is better documented and more maintainable.

All demo models have been updated to use the new organization. hasim_common is
now a submodel.

TBD: separate platform_interface from fpgaenv.

Rearranged the Functional Partition to make deprecated modules more obvious.

Added support in the functional partiton for Memory Virtual Device. For now a
"null" cache simply passes all requests on to the memory device.

- added a hasim demo for testing the memory device. The demo
  currently does not build properly; this will be fixed in
  an upcoming commit.

- plugged dangling soft-connections to memory in Platform
  Interface by looping them back in the same module. This
  is a temporary "fix" and will be removed soon.

- added a new module called "ConnectionTerminus" that terminates
  dangling connections. Each connection that can be potentially
  "plugged" (i.e., stubbed-in) by ConnectionTerminus has an
  associated parameter whose value specifies whether the connection
  needs to be plugged or not. The set of connections in this module
  needs to be kept consistent with the complementary set in HAsim
  Platform Interface.

- removed loopback connection stubs from HAsim Platform Interface.

- updated all existing APM models to use the Connection Terminus.
  Parameter values have been set appropriately.

- updated the Hybrid Memory Test model + modules. The model now
  builds and simulates correctly with the updated platform modules.

- Clean up dependence in makefiles.  In particular, "make bit" now knows it
  must first compile the bsv files.
- Remove the logic from hasim-connect that attempted to decide whether to
  rebuild the connection.  The makefiles now fully describe dependence.
  The logic in hasim-connect, while technically correct, caused connection
  files not to be rebuilt sometimes.  The Bluespec compiler then failed
  because of timestamp mismatches on input files.

RRR Service Collection: instead of a global RRR service list, modules
providing RRR services can now specify the set of services they provide
in a distributed manner. Module-local RRR files are all collected by
hasim-configure and concatenated into a master service list, which can be
imported by the server main routine.

Notes:
- currently, the .rrr file within a module must have a unique name, e.g.,
  two modules cannot use the same filename "service-list.rrr". This is not
  a huge issue, but it is an unnecessary restriction since the individual
  .rrr files are read only once by hasim-configure and are not used by the
  build process. Also, unnecessary symlinks to these files are created in
  the build directory.

- currently, only the software side uses this master service list to
  generate service method names and service IDs. The BSV side is still
  hard-coded with service IDs. Adding or removing services (to/from the
  existing front-panel+memory set) will almost certainly break all models.
  This will be fixed soon; until then, please do not add/remove any services!

- the current infrastructure only supports software services. Implementing
  hardware services will require maintaining two separate master service
  lists.

RRR Client Registration: hasim-configure, while recursively
generating the master RRR file, also keeps track of the
sequence number (serviceID) that each service will receive
in the final master sequence. These serviceIDs are printed into
the module's BSV include file as `defines with a macro names
that the module recognizes (derived from the parameter to the
ADD_SERVICE macro calls in the module's .rrr file). The client
thus obtains all serviceIDs it needs to use.

- fixed a small bug in Makefile.top

- slightly changed MemTest: it now displays Hello, World!
  only once and exits. Earlier, it was coded to display the
  message ad-infinitum in a loop because $finish caused the
  hybrid simulation to exit un-cleanly. This has been fixed.

- also updated MemTest to display the message on stderr
  instead of stdout.

  **** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

  Please do not use $display or $write in BSV code henceforth.
  If the module in which this code is used happens to be placed
  inside a hybrid model, then stdout of the simulation
  executable gets plugged into the software executable, and
  the $display strings will confuse the communication protocol.

  Instead, use $fdisplay(stderr, ...) or $fwrite(stderr, ...).

  no longer goes through top level synthesis when not needed.
- Software-side binary is built automatically.
- All module parameters from AWB files are now exposed as potential
  replacement strings during Makefile generation.  Added a parameter
  MAKE_ALL_TARGET to the standard HAsim Makefile.top.template.  The
  paramter defaults to "exe".
- Set MAKE_ALL_TARGET to "bit" for traffic light XUP models.
