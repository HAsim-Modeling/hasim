Added support for a synthesized bsv file that corresponds to
each awb module and is named with the asim meta-type (%provides name).
All 'imports' should use these files instead of any specific
implementation file names.

This relaxes the restriction that a module implementation file
name must be well known by the parent module.

Fixed up the switch_to_led modules to use this convention.

First cut at new implementation of synthesis boundaries. It doesn't 
work, but neither does it break models with no synthesis boundaries.

Added file missing from last commit.

Okay, so hasim-connect didn't really work (even without a
synthesis boundary). It should now.

Also took advantage of the fact that all bsv implementations 
of an Asim module don't have to have the same filename.

Committing a fairly major change to the HAsim functional partition. This change
encompasses several things:

1) It brings BRAMs up for Bluesim allowing us to run Bluesim models if the software fpgalib is selected.

2) During simulation it loads the program from a .vmh file on disk rather than
from a hardcoded program. This allows us to run benchmarks via the awb interface.

3) The main memory is now a unified memory rather than IMem/DMem. An on-FPGA
cache hierachy should be added later.

Deleting files no longer need in the FPGA lib. Some models will need to be altered.

It seems that MIT was using an Bluespec undocumented syntax that was actually
illegal and is no longer supported by the compiler. Things have been fixed to be
forward- and backward-compatible.

- Added a virtual platform hierarchy that pure bluespec models can now use
  to interact with virtual devices. Basic framework for some sample virtual
  device sets has been added to the virtual platform to assist virtual
  device writers in figuring out where in the hierarchy the device
  implementations should be placed.

- Added a unix-channelio module that encapsulates primitives required for
  a bluespec module to communicate with a UNIX process.

- Added an implementation of the FrontPanel virtual device. This virtual
  device provides a set of virtual LEDs and switches to a bluespec model.
  This particular implementation emulates these LEDs and switches by
  instantiating a hasim-front-panel dialog box and using the channelio
  module.

- Modified the pure-bluespec counter demo example to use the virtual
  platform and FrontPanel virtual device. The current testbench does not
  count anything, but simply loads all inputs into the counter each
  cycle and sends the contents of the counter's latch each cycle to
  the LEDs.

- Added a pure-bluespec multiplier example, which also uses the FrontPanel
  virtual device. The model treats switches 0-1 and 2-3 as two 2-bit
  unsigned integers, multiplies them when the OK button is pressed using
  a shift-and-add multiplier, and displays the result (when available) as
  a 4-bit unsigned integer on the LEDs.

- Modified the "software" FPGA library to use the virtual platform
  infrastructure. HAsim models can now talk to virtual devices via
  connections through the software FPGA library. (Previously, only
  pure Bluespec models were able to use virtual devices).

- Created software versions of the switch2led HAsim APM models.

- Modified the hasim_null_controller to remove references to the
  deprecated TModule identifiers.

- Modified the hasim-configure/Makefile process in order to compile
  and link models using BDPI in a much cleaner fashion. Modules
  with BDPI C files will now need to specify the names of all BDPI
  methods that the C file exports using a %param declaration. These
  names are used my hasim-configure and the Makefiles to locate
  temporary BDPI-specific .ba object files.

- Added an explicit path to lcurses in the BSC command line in order to
  enable the linker to work correctly on Suse 2.6 systems.

- Moved the TopLevel interface definition from hasim_base to hasim_fpgalib.
  Currently, only the software virtual-platform-enabled fpgalib
  implementation has this functionality; therefore, in order to not break
  existing models that are configured with either the non-virtual-platform
  software fpgalib or the XUP fpgalib, the existing hasim_base has not
  been touched. Instead, an alternate hasim_base has been created, which
  does not have the TopLevel definition. All models using the software
  virtual-platform fpgalib must use this alternate hasim_base. Eventually,
  all models will use this new hasim_base.

- Updated the switch2led hasim demos to use the new fpgalib/base
  combination.

- Fixed a minor bug in the hasim top-level Makefile that was generating
  a "rm -f /*.*" command when called with "make clean".

- Added an FPGA Environment (fpgaenv) module hierarchy which is required
  by hasim-common. The module hierarchy underneath fpgaenv comprises of
  the virtual-platform (which has been moved from fpgalib to fpgaenv),
  fpga-components (which contains components such as the BRAM),
  toplevel-wires (magic wires that get mapped to a UCF file), and 
  platform-interface (plumbing code that ties hasim connections to the
  virtual platform).

  Note: fpgalib is now deprecated. In order to maintain temporary
  backwards compatibility, it still exists in the module hierarchy.
  However, to use it, models must use the "deprecated hasim-common" and
  "deprecated hasim-base" modules. In order to ensure compatibility with
  hasim-connect, toplevel_wires is now a dummy requirement for fpgalib.
  Please use the Null toplevel wires module for all fpgalib models.

- Top-level wires have been moved from fpgalib into a separate module
  underneath fpgaenv. Connections.bsv, while instantiating the top level,
  now instantiates a platform-interface (instead of fpgalib). The platform
  interface instantiates the top-level wires and the necessary virtual
  devices, and passes a pointer to the top-level wires module to all
  virtual devices.

- Modified the switch2led demos to use the new fpgaenv.
  Modified the pure bluespec demos to use the new virtual platform and
      top-level wires.
  All other hasim demos continue to use fpgalib (along with the deprecated
      hasim-base and hasim-common modules).

- Added two submodels for fpgaenv, one for Software and the other for XUP
  models.

- Removed two old submodels for hasim-common.

- Updated the switch2led demo configs to adjust for the
  above movement.

have been separated from the "driver" wires (coming from the FPGA
model) by placing them in a sub-interface.

- Added a method to unix-channelio which allows a module
  using the channel to detect if the connected UNIX process
  has exited.

- Added a rule to the graphical front panel which probes the
  above method and terminates the simulation if channelio
  has detected a process exit.

- Fixed a small bug in hasim-connect

Updated the traffic light example to work with the new fpgaenv structure.
To work reasonably in simulation the traffic light delay was made
a paramater and set very short for the software simulation versions.

Updated hasim-connect to include module parameters for the build
of the module at the synthesis boundary.

Hasim and Pure Bluespec models using BDPI will now compile into
vexe and work properly with the iVerilog simulator. However, the
existing iverilog distribution on /proj/vssad will not work, a
development snapshot of iverilog, version 0.9.devel build 2007/04/21
or later is required.

I have a temporary installation of this build set up in my home
directory. If you wish to use this, you need to add
    /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/bin
to your PATH and make sure iverilog, iverilog-vpi and vvp are picked
up from this directory. Also, Makefile.include.template for both
Hasim and pure bluespec models temporarily contains an additional
include path to /home/aparasha/i386-linux26/include. These will be
updated when the new iverilog version is installed in /proj/vssad.

- Updated Makefiles to remove a hard include path to temporarily-
  installed iverilog distribution and instead pick up the path
  from an environment variable created by setup-hasim.

- Added a hack to the Makefiles to work around a bsc compiler
  bug which prevents it from looking for object files in the
  specified directories. The workarounds should be removed
  when the compiler bug is fixed.

1) Local Controller stub is in place. Currently it starts the program via scanchain and returns when done. It
_could_ control the Ports except that the Ports just always say that they are ready and balanced.

2) Makefile now returns 1 correctly if a subdirectory fails. It turns out that the for-loop in the Makefile
was a bash for-loop rather than a Makefile for-loop. This confusion meant that the for-loop returned
"success" [0] even if a child process had failed [1]. We now test for this explicitly and bottom-out
correctly. This might fix some of the weirdness people had experienced at synthesis boundaries with
connections, as these rely on logfiles which might have gotten confused by the incorrect bottoming-out.

More Makefile changes: Now even more intelligent about not recompiling. The insight was that if you do a command like:

all:
      <compile>
      cp file1 file2

Make was taking its cue about success or failure from the cp command rather than the compilation. Should be fixed now.

Store buffer now initializes its BRAMs manually.

Store buffer didnt behave correctly during back-to-back store followed by load, because the store request was still in fifo whereas the load proceeded without looking at the fifo. So I changed
store to hold on to a lock.This makes the model pass all test cases

"pass-through" and "add1". Two models showing off these algorithms.

Some minor changes to hasim_common which converts some previously hard-coded
numbers into AWB parameters.

TBD: add support for multiple FPGA synthesis environments to support FSB flow.

* The store buffer/memstate are a little more parameterized

* The Makefiles are once again more intelligent about exit conditions. It turns
out that "tee" can wreak havoc on exit codes. The use of the BASH "trap" command
and special ${PIPESTATUS} variable now combats that.

- Added an implementation of an RPC-based virtual platform
  infrastructure designed to support hybrid hardware/software module
  development. The software module partitions currently reside
  together with the software RPC stub both in the module hierarchy
  as well as the source tree, but will be moved away later.

- Added an FPGA Environment submodel that conveniently wraps all
  modules required for a consistent hybrid RPC-based platform.

- Added a Hybrid Front Panel virtual device to demonstrate this
  infrastructure.

First pass of Makefile cleanup:
 - Express independence of subdirectory builds as Make rules.
 - Remove separate Netbatch rules.  We can add netbatch back later as a
   special instance of the compiler, not a rule.
 - The model build rules are now target independent.  Building bit, exe
   and vexe differ only at the top level.
 - Each subdirectory has its own .bsc temporary directory to avoid
   potential name clashes.
 - Removed "realclean" rules.  "clean" now removes everything.

Redid synthesis architecture. XUP is supported in the new architecture and
should transparently work like before. UCF and other files are aggregated from

- hasim-bsc-mkdepend computes full dependence graph for source modules
- Build in parallel when possible
- Each subdirectory still has its own build directory but all others
  can now share the results.  Previous check in didn't, forcing lots of
  duplicate builds.
- Directory structure still makes it difficult to compute full dependence
  graph.  Many modules are rebuilt unnecessarily.

Changes to the new functional partition. All tests now pass on the 5-stage timing model.

Benchmarks run between ~9000 and ~66000 model cycles before deadlocking due to a remaining bug in the Store Buffer.

New functional partition should be as mature as existing now.

- Separated the software module source files (for hybrid modules) from
  the software main server (earlier, all software module files were
  residing with the software RRR server code).

- Changed all "*RPC*" names to "*RRR*"

- Added support for service modules to register themselves with the
  RRR server, without the server having explicit knowledge of the set
  of services it is going to host. Currently, we are using a global
  map table of services to accomplish this, but this will be updated
  to a more distributed approach.

- Added a preliminary implementation for building hardware and software
  module trees independently into a hardware target (simulation executable
  or bitfile) and a software target (executable). The AWB build dialog
  box will build the hardware target only. To build the software target,
  do into the build directory and type "make swexe" at a console prompt.

hasim_common reorg. Soft Connections have been separated out and moved into
Bluespec common (soft_connections). Smart Synthesis Boundaries are now a
separate module (smart_synth_boundaries). Modeling constructs are now in
hasim_modellib.

Many deprecated elements of hasim_common have been deleted.

Soft Connections code is better documented and more maintainable.

All demo models have been updated to use the new organization. hasim_common is
now a submodel.

TBD: separate platform_interface from fpgaenv.

Rearranged the Functional Partition to make deprecated modules more obvious.

Added support in the functional partiton for Memory Virtual Device. For now a
"null" cache simply passes all requests on to the memory device.

- added a hasim demo for testing the memory device. The demo
  currently does not build properly; this will be fixed in
  an upcoming commit.

- plugged dangling soft-connections to memory in Platform
  Interface by looping them back in the same module. This
  is a temporary "fix" and will be removed soon.

- added a new module called "ConnectionTerminus" that terminates
  dangling connections. Each connection that can be potentially
  "plugged" (i.e., stubbed-in) by ConnectionTerminus has an
  associated parameter whose value specifies whether the connection
  needs to be plugged or not. The set of connections in this module
  needs to be kept consistent with the complementary set in HAsim
  Platform Interface.

- removed loopback connection stubs from HAsim Platform Interface.

- updated all existing APM models to use the Connection Terminus.
  Parameter values have been set appropriately.

- updated the Hybrid Memory Test model + modules. The model now
  builds and simulates correctly with the updated platform modules.

- Clean up dependence in makefiles.  In particular, "make bit" now knows it
  must first compile the bsv files.
- Remove the logic from hasim-connect that attempted to decide whether to
  rebuild the connection.  The makefiles now fully describe dependence.
  The logic in hasim-connect, while technically correct, caused connection
  files not to be rebuilt sometimes.  The Bluespec compiler then failed
  because of timestamp mismatches on input files.

RRR Service Collection: instead of a global RRR service list, modules
providing RRR services can now specify the set of services they provide
in a distributed manner. Module-local RRR files are all collected by
hasim-configure and concatenated into a master service list, which can be
imported by the server main routine.

Notes:
- currently, the .rrr file within a module must have a unique name, e.g.,
  two modules cannot use the same filename "service-list.rrr". This is not
  a huge issue, but it is an unnecessary restriction since the individual
  .rrr files are read only once by hasim-configure and are not used by the
  build process. Also, unnecessary symlinks to these files are created in
  the build directory.

- currently, only the software side uses this master service list to
  generate service method names and service IDs. The BSV side is still
  hard-coded with service IDs. Adding or removing services (to/from the
  existing front-panel+memory set) will almost certainly break all models.
  This will be fixed soon; until then, please do not add/remove any services!

- the current infrastructure only supports software services. Implementing
  hardware services will require maintaining two separate master service
  lists.

RRR Client Registration: hasim-configure, while recursively
generating the master RRR file, also keeps track of the
sequence number (serviceID) that each service will receive
in the final master sequence. These serviceIDs are printed into
the module's BSV include file as `defines with a macro names
that the module recognizes (derived from the parameter to the
ADD_SERVICE macro calls in the module's .rrr file). The client
thus obtains all serviceIDs it needs to use.

- fixed a small bug in Makefile.top

- slightly changed MemTest: it now displays Hello, World!
  only once and exits. Earlier, it was coded to display the
  message ad-infinitum in a loop because $finish caused the
  hybrid simulation to exit un-cleanly. This has been fixed.

- also updated MemTest to display the message on stderr
  instead of stdout.

  **** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

  Please do not use $display or $write in BSV code henceforth.
  If the module in which this code is used happens to be placed
  inside a hybrid model, then stdout of the simulation
  executable gets plugged into the software executable, and
  the $display strings will confuse the communication protocol.

  Instead, use $fdisplay(stderr, ...) or $fwrite(stderr, ...).

  no longer goes through top level synthesis when not needed.
- Software-side binary is built automatically.
- All module parameters from AWB files are now exposed as potential
  replacement strings during Makefile generation.  Added a parameter
  MAKE_ALL_TARGET to the standard HAsim Makefile.top.template.  The
  paramter defaults to "exe".
- Set MAKE_ALL_TARGET to "bit" for traffic light XUP models.

 HybridSimpleController.bsv Locally Modified          277 

Intermediate checkin towards building support for sending
stats and events to the software partition. The hybrid controller's
code will be in an inconsistent state after this commit, and any
models using it will be broken.

- moved connection terminus from a controller submodule to
  a single file within the hasim platform interface module.

- disabled queuing events in EventController_Simulation. Since
  the main controller is not de-queuing them, pure (non-hybrid)
  simulation models were stalling. This is a temporary fix to
  ensure that the models continue to build and run while a
  cleaner solution is implemented.

- updated connection terminus parameters in config files.

Fixed bug in connection chains. Connection chains are now used more consistently
between stats/events, increasing readability. This also removes the workaround
which was in the hybrid controller.

This is the first step towards abstracting out the interconnection network which
stats/events/commands use to have more alternatives than scanchains.

Events and Stats no longer have separate hybrid/simulation controllers. Instead
the only point of choice is in the controller itself, which is either simulation
or hybrid. This is the first step towrards a hub/ring topology.

- All module parameters that used to be written to module level BSV files
  built by hasim-configure are now written to a file with the BSH suffix.
  Instead of importing interfaces you should instead include the BSH
  file.  From the BSH include you get all the `defines.  The BSH file
  imports the interface.
- Change platform interface to use LED and switch types from the platform.
- Change traffic light to use unsized integer values for writing LEDs.
  The example now works with configurations having 4 or more LEDs.

I finally figured out why my text editor was occaisionally randomly inserting
tabs into the source code, which was then messing up the formatting for everyone
else. I have consequently excised all tabs from the source files, as the start
of moving us towards a unified coding convention.

(The platforms repository is already tab-free.)

Added Waterlevel Ports to Modellib. These have large buffering, then use Stats
to track the maximum number of elements they observe. Then you can go back and
pick optimal buffering for your Ports.

Also a small change in hasim-configure. Cleaned up the surrogates that get
generated initially.

 Assertions.bsv            Locally Added               0 


Added a first pass at assertions. The assertions interface is in place, but uses the scanchain.

Assertions are very "imprecise" in that it may be many FPGA cycles before we
notice an assertion has been raised. Additionally, if more than one assertion is
raised then it is possible that we will report a derivative assertion rather
than the one that was the root cause. There's probably no way to avoid this
without changing the interconnect topology (a longterm project.)

- added support for auto-generating C++ header files for AWB interfaces

- major controller reorganization. There are two primary AWB controllers,
  Null and Standard, and out of these, four new submodels have been created:
  - Hardware-Only Null Controller
  - Hardware-Only Standard Controller
  - Hybrid Null Controller
  - Hybrid Standard Controller

  Of these, the "Hardware-Only Standard Controller" is not fully functional
  (it does not display $display messages correctly during pure simulation).
  Therefore, the old submodel called

  - Simulation-Only Simple Controller (deprecated)
  
  has been retained and is being used by all pure-simulation and
  pure-hardware models until implementation of a dictionary-based streams
  virtual device is complete.

Major change to the build environment.  All C++/H files now are built
in a separate software (sw) tree.  All interface files (dict, rrr) are
built in an iface tree.  The iface tree is built before the hw or
sw trees.

RRR files are now generated dynamically at build time.  Source changes
no longer require reconfiguration.

The sw and iface trees are more Asim-like.  Generated header files must
be included as "asim/provides/foo.h".  The iface is similar.  Dictionary
files are included as "asim/dict/foo.h" or "asim/dict/foo.bsh" and RRR
files are "asim/rrr/foo.h".

The hasim-rrr-stubgen now takes all the source .rrr files and generates
stubs in a single pass.

Added new functional partition verson with macro-op style arrangement. Currently
something is wrong in that the performance is very poor (approximately 24 FPGA
cycles for one model cycle.)

The new partition follows the standardized coding conventions and will enable
MIPS ISA support.

- modified command controller to talk to streams virtual device
- modified memtest to use streams instead of $display
- added fpga->host endSim RRR call to hybrid Starter
- added endSim call to simulation Starter that calls $finish()
- modified command controller to call Starter.endSim() at end
  of simulation (instead of directly calling $finish()).

Put generated Bluespec interface include files in asim/provides tree.

For now you can include these interface files either with the new style:

`include "asim/provides/foo.bsh"

or the old style:

`include "foo.bsh"

This works because both the root of the include tree and the leaf are
on the include search path.  When we are ready we can drop the leaf
from the search path by editing SCons.hw.template.

- renamed command controller to module controller
- re-distributed responsibilities of standard, module,
  event, stat and assertion controllers.
- updated 'starter' module to include a new set of
  command interfaces used by standard controller
- updated MemTest to use dictionaries.
- moved dictionaries from streams into the actual
  subcontroller modules that use them.

Move Bluespec definition of dictionary tokens into compiled bsv files
instead of bsh header files.  Bluespec does type comparison using a combination
of module and type name.  In order to avoid redundant strings the names
of objects in the enumerations no longer have the dictionary name.

No changes for C++ code.

Dictionary types are now specified as DICT_<name>::DICT_<name>, e.g.
DICT_STREAMS::DICT_STREAMS.

Dictionary entries are now: DICT_<name>::<id>, e..g
DICT_STREAMS::STAT_INSTS_COMMITTED.

Dictionaries are now hierarchical.  Dictionary A may have a sub-dictionary
B using the syntax:

   def A.B.FOO "foo string";

Breaking up the dictionary allows modules to define their own sub-dictionaries
of a larger category.  The sub-dictionaries share the same numbering space.
Including the header file at a given level in the tree automatically imports
all definitions below the level.  With this mechanism recompilation due
to dictionary changes can be minimized.

In C++ the name of the printing class changed from DICT_<NAME> to <NAME>_DICT.

In Bluespec the elements are now preprocessor definitions, e.g.
     `define STREAMID_ASSERT 0
The Bluespec ID to string function is now in a module named <NAME>_DICT and
the function is named show<NAME>_DICT.

* Events and Stats and Assertions now use dictionaries.
* Instantiations have been changed to take a dictionary entry.
* Ring numbers are now assigned via a dictionary (RINGID).

TODO: Rings for Events and Stats currently send complete StreamIDs. They should
probably operate on STREAM->EVENT and STREAM->STAT IDs respectively, and their
controllers should "globalize" the names before sending onto the streams device.

Finished update of pure bluespec models to use new fpgaenv.

Added a new module parameter for use at synthesis boundaries, 
"SMART_SYNTH_BOUNDARY". It has a default of true (1) so that 
exisiting code that uses soft connections will continue to work.
But with a value of false (0) no soft connection code will
be generated by hasim-configure. That means that pure bluespec
models with no synthesis boundaries (except at the top level)
will work. There is, however, no support for other synthesis 
boundaries for models that don't use soft connections.

Hasim-configure was updated to respect the SMART_SYNTH_BOUNDARY
parameter described above.

The pure Bluespec 'multiplier' model was updated.

* Added support for load byte/halfword/word in Functional Partition V3.

* Support is done in the functional partition using a read-modify-write loop so
the memory device / cache / store buffer are agnostic to this capabiilty.

* This will be used in the full MIPS ISA.

* Changed Platform Interface to use the new memory virtual device.

 hasim-rrr-stubgen         Locally Modified          343 

Updated hardware RRR service stubs to match slightly modified
Demarshaller interface. The new stubs are also simpler in
functionality because they rely on the Demarshaller's internal
state machine to take care of flow control.

Updated the hasim platform interface to use the front panel
and streams virtual devices with individual arguments
to the remote methods rather than passing a struct as
the only argument.

Also updated the pure Bluespec demos to do the same. Added
a demo that uses both the streams, and front panel devices.
And did a re-arrangement of the bluespec demo models.

- hasim-bsc-mkdepend can now use iverilog as a preprocessor.  bsc is slow because
  it allocates a license each time it runs.  The script still uses bsc if
  iverilog isn't found.

- SCons.top.template now supports the latest Bluespec compiler release.  The
  method for building Bluesim objects keeps changing.  Instead of trying to keep
  up we now use the standard bsc command.  This gives up on some parallelism,
  but the latest compiler can change the C++ optimization level.  I picked -O1
  because the binaries generated are faster by at least as much as the extra
  compilation time.

- SCons.top.template now queries the Bluespec compiler version.  As a result,
  the script remains compatible with older Bluespec releases.

- added support for RRR response path for sw client/hwserver to stubgen.

- changed the manner in which connection-type stubs are generated. The
  monolithic module with all service connections and interface code has
  been done away with. Individual modules are now created for each
  service and placed into independent files (similar to how stubs are
  created for direct method-call stubs). All stub functionalities (i.e.,
  interfacing with the RRR server, creating the de/marshallers, type
  conversions etc.) are inside these modules.

  These modules are then instantiated by a wrapper module
  mkServiceConnections(), which also instantiates the necessary soft
  connections and rules to translate method calls to connection messages.

- changed the naming convention for generated RRR stub files. Filenames
  are no longer generated based on input filename; they are derived from
  the names of the Services as specified in the RRR spec file. (e.g.,
  old = "hybrid-basic-starter.bsh", new = "rrr_service_stub_STARTER.bsh").

- re-organized stubgen code to remove large unreadable code blocks. Also
  got rid of a lot of code that was replicated between connection-style
  and method-style stub generation. 

- updated hybrid basic Starter to use newly available response path for
  the DumpStats method (previously, it was using the hw->sw RRR client
  to send the response).

Moved the pure Bluespec model foundations into the same
directory as the Hasim model foundations so they can 
share the build scripts. 

Fixed up the pure Bluespec models to use the moved
model modules.

These models still don't build because of the new
hasim-module.{h,cpp} files used by some fpgaenv modules.
The problem is that hasim-module lives in the controller, 
which isn't used in pure Bluespec models.

* Events now use RRR instead of streams.
* Events-controller is now a hybrid hardware/software module.
* Event instantiations should be updated to use the correct dictionary.
* Events now take "event name" strings at instantiation rather than a message.

* Rearranged Controllers to the new organization. There are now only 3 controllers:
     * Hybrid Standard
     * Hybrid Null
     * Hardware-Only Null
* Split HAsim Model into Hybrid and Hardware-only models.
* Removed some obsolete models.
* Reconfigured all models to use the new model/controller/fpgaenv organization. 
* This organization should now be consistent: Hybrid everywhere or HW-only everywhere.

Still Ongoing:
* Refactor modellib into local controllers.
* Rename model files to be more consistent.

Updated pure-bluespec main to new global arguments format.

Moved platforms-module to low-level-platforms-interface. (Again it should really
be a library.)

TODO: Global Arguments should be part of a library once we support it, rather
than in main.h.

Version 3 of the Functional Partition now supports an isa-emulator service via
RRR.

Upon encountering an emulated instruction, the current value of all registers is
passed to the software via the RRR syncRegister() call. Then a call to
emulateInstruction() is made. The software makes one or more calls to
updateRegister(), and finally a call to emulationFinished(). (This last call
will eventually be replaced with an ACK.)

Removed some exraneous instantiations from the controller.

- Teach the scons software-side builder to link with m5.  m5 sources aren't
  configured as part of the model.  Instead, m5 is built as part of the
  configure/make step in checking out an ISA-specific repository.  The
  model build step knows to link with m5 when a magic parameter is set.
- main() passes command line parameters to the virtual platform (m5).
  This will need to be more intelligent to pass the right subset of parameters.

Time for HAsim software build environment to grow up:
  - Honor command line DEBUG/OPT and workspace default in awb.config.
  - Use %library and %include directives from config files
  - We now build with libasim and libdral.
  - We don't yet use asim/syntax.h, but should soon.

- main() now parses an argument (--funcp="<arg>") to a separate argument
  vector and passes it to the functional platform.  The --benchmark
  parameter is gone.

- All benchmarks (smips and alpha) are now set up by a single script

- Alpha/m5 simulation now loads a standard Alpha binary and returns control
  to HAsim.

- The benchmark run scripts now take a --gdb argument.  The script invokes
  gdb and passes all the necessary commands to run a benchmark.

- Stubgen completely restructured, but no additional functionality
  is visible yet. All existing models should behave exactly as
  before.

- Changed naming conventions for generated RRR files. All "rrr_"
  prefixes are unnecessary (since all generated files are anyway
  in an rrr/ directory) and have been removed.

- The term "service stub" is ambiguous since a service has a
  server component and a client component. All server-side stubs
  are now called "server_stub_<servicename>". Client stubs will
  be called "client_stub_<servicename>" once this functionality
  is enabled. All generated stub filenames now reflect this
  nomenclature.

- Updated module BSV files to include the renamed stubs.

I believe there was a type in regstate_manager_macro_ops.bsv, line 987.
I also changed the ISA_REG_INDEX to a bit-vector type because it uses maxBound, and is used in array indexing, both of which can't be done easily with tagged unions. I will be changing the return type of getIsaSrc and getIsaDst to return Bits instead.

- added support for hardware-side Client stub printing
  and automatic generation of client connections (not
  fully tested).

- added a null entry to the ASSERTIONS dictionary to
  enable demo hybrid models to build correctly.

- changed some more incorrect "...service..." names
  to "...server...".

- Separate memory into two categories.  Functional model memory now is defined
  under the functional model.  The memory defined in the FPGA environment
  is now just scratchpad memory.  Either memory may be hybrid.
- Hybrid functional memory is two components:  communication with the host and
  memory management.  Separate the two.  VMH is defined as a manager.  Soon
  m5 will be, too.
- Put isa_emulator in hasim_funcp.  hasim_funcp now requires hasim_isa_semantics.
  If the ISA semantics are hybrid then a hybrid isa_emulator may be chosen under
  semantics.

- Fix sw side preprocessor definitions for 32-bit Linux.  Resulted in wrong
  definition of UINT64.
- Add support for standard Asim TRACE
- hasim-dict generated the wrong code when there was exactly one object in
  the dictionary and the object was in a sub-dictionary.
- Fix the printing of errors in the events controller.

- Break apart hybrid functional memory into two clean pieces.  One handles RRR
  and the other handles simulated memory.  There is a clean interface to
  simulated memory so VMH could be replaced by m5 with no changes to the RRR
  code.
- The simulated memory interface now supports accesses of any size.  The RRR
  code still uses on 32 bit references.  That part will need to change.

- modified Funcp Memory to behave as an RRR service talking to
  the platform via auto-generated connections (instead of a
  virtual device). This breaks Funcp v2.

- generalized Funcp Memory to support multiple address and data
  widths. The widths can be changed now by simply modifying the
  AWB parameters.

- changed name of links between FuncpMemory and MemstateCache
  to "funcp_memory..." instead of "vdev_memory...".

- modified Platform Interface to translate calls to scratchpad
  memory instead of funcp memory.

- retained the temporary include for funcp_memory.bsh in Platform
  Interface. This is required for the connection types to be
  visible at Platform Interface, which instantiates the auto-
  generated connections module. This causes all non-SMIPS
  HAsim models to break (they were already broken before this
  check in). This will be fixed soon.

  - Add "EVENTS=1" to the awb.config file in your workspace
  - Add "EVENTS=1" to the build command line

The build command line overrides the value from the workspace.

- Generalize the argc/argv building code and promote --bluesimargs to
  an argc/argv pair.
- Invoke bluesim with execvp()
- Add --funcp-prefix and --funcp-suffix options to the run script for specifying
  options to m5.

NOTE:  The run script may strip quotation marks around the bluesimargs option.
       From a shell you probably need to use: ./run --bluesimargs=\"-V elvis\"

Tired of redundant sizes sprinkled through the functional partition
configurations.  Created one, top level, "funcp_base_types" requirement.
Files in the base types must be terminal within the functional partition.
For now defined here is the ISA address size and the integer register
size.  From these other parts of the functional partition pick sizes
for funcp_memory and isa_emulator.  The only remaining other place where
a size is needed is the memory_store_info_size in funcp_memory, due to
temporary RRR limitations.  The sw side of the memory interface verifies
that memory_store_info_size is set correctly.

Also changed the protocol for ISA emulator to return a branch.  Using
the high bit caused problems since we can't know where the high bit is
without assuming a PC size.  Since the branch bit as part of the returned
PC is a temporary hack I used bits 1:0, which must be 0 for both Alpha and
MIPS.  Of the 4 states, 0 is no branch, 1 is branch, 2 is unused and 3
means terminate.  The exit status is in bit 2 for terminate.

Compute the array sizes for cross-synthesis-boundary soft connections
at compile time instead of using large static arrays using a two pass
compilation scheme.  Only early phases of the compiler are used for the
first pass to avoid wasting time.

Reducing the array sizes saves 70% of the Xilinx Xst (synthesis) time
for the smips 5 stage model.  Down to 50 minutes.  There is still room
for improvement!

The maximum array sizes (100) are now defined in the wrapper template
created by hasim-configure.  Bluespec gets slow beyond about 100,
otherwise there is no reason it has to be so low.

- Break apart ISA emulation into two components:  one to handle RRR that
  is simulator independent and an ISA emulator implementation that is
  simulator (e.g. m5) dependent.
- Defined a NULL emulator implementation that forces a failed exit in the
  hardware if called.

- Priority hacks in RRR stub generation:
  - Force Bluespec scheduler to give priority to methods in order of method
    number.  (Low number == highest priority)
  - Force a service named FUNCP_MEMORY to be service ID 0.  The priority tree
    for favors services sorted by ID.  This gives memory the highest priority.
    We can now be sure in an unpiplined timing model that all memory stores
    for earlier cycles complete before an ISA emulation request is transmitted
    to software.  We can still make no guarantees for pipelined timing models.

- Run script puts quotation marks back around arguments when needed so

  of adding shell escapes.
- Merge help messages from run script and model using a hidden switch to
  the model.

- Updated implementation and UI for connection-based stubs. These RRR
  services now generate the following 3 entities:

  - a regular client/server stub that talks to the RRR stack. This stub
    uses packed-Bit#() types, and so does not need to include the definitions
    of any abstract RRR types.

  - a set of connections and rules as part of HAsim Platform Interface
    (in client_connections.bsh and server_connections.bsh), which also use
    packed-Bit#() types, thereby avoiding any include requirements.

  - a "remote" client/serve stub that uses the abstract types specified in the
    RRR spec file. Since this remote stub is going to be instantiated by the
    end-user module that "owns" these abstract types, it has access to them.
    Internally, this stub talks to the remote end of the connection(s) and
    performs the pack/unpack.

  Note that the remote end-user module must now include "remote_client_stub_XXX"
  instead of "client_stub_XXX", but the actual Bluespec interface and module names
  do not need any prefix, e.g., ClientStub_XXX <- mkClientStub_XXX();

  Services still use multiple connections for their various methods, but this
  can now be changed internally without impacting the end-user modules' syntax.

- Updated regstate manager and hybrid starter to use the new remote stubs.

- Removed unnecessary `includes from HAsimPlatformInterface.bsv. HAsim Demo models
  should now work, but haven't been tested yet.

- Added a couple of params to isa-emulator.awb to explicitly specify the
  bit-widths of aggregated RRR types.

Fixes to get simpler non-model designs running. Major change
was adding %library directive for libasim into bluespec_common.
This, unfortunately, is an unnecessary dependency for non-hybrid
models, so probably should change, either by moving the %library
directive or creating hybrid and non-hybrid versions of the
bluespec_common module. Also added non-functional support for
switches needed by the platform. We still need to modularize
switch processing better.

Created a separate module for command line switch processing. That
module is used by main and %required by the hybrid controllers. A
controller was added to the pure bluespec models so they can share the
switch parsing. Those models are currently using the full hasim switch
parser, which is overkill but works. 

Moved the %library specification of libasim to hasim_common to match
the convention in the the pure bluespec designs.

Added a  regression run for the base hasim package. This benchmark
currently builds but does not run properly.

Switched the null benchmark to use the standard setup-bmark
script and modified that script to handle the 'none' feeder
and the run.bmark script to create a fake stats file for that
feeder as well.

Now the 'hello world' hybrid demo runs and passes as a 
regression. So in your asimrc file one can test the hasim,
hasim-alpha, and hasim-mips package with the lines:

[regression.launcher]
PACKAGES=hasim,hasim-alpha,hasim-mips

Cope with the fact that m5 uses mysql if it exists and doesn't
if it doesn't. So we need to conditionally link in mysqlclient.a.

I think we should figure out a way to get all this meta-logic out of

- Make stdout and stderr line buffered.  LEDs and error messages now
  come out when you'd expect.
- Enhance showfp switch.  Now takes arguments:  gui, stdout and none.
  Null benchmark defaults to stdout.  Others default to none.  Logic
  controlled mostly in run.bmark.

- I have changed the size of the offset to 3 bits instead of 2, and
  parametrized it in the process, so the number 3 actually comes from
  log(`FUNCP_ISA_INT_REG_SIZE/8). (8 is hardcoded, because 8 bits make a byte,
  and that's not really going to change :) )

- There was another (minor) bug: the tag was defined to have (64-8) bits, when
  it should have been (64-8-2) bits. Fixed that.

- I have added a soft-connection funcp_invalidate_all from
  mkFUNCP_RegStateManager to mkFUNCP_Cache. Whenever the reg-state decides to
  emulate an instruction, it sends an invalidate_all request to the cache. Not
  sure, if this should be routed through the mem-state instead.

- Currently, this blocks all future cache requests, and does not bypass them.

- I am still not sure how we sync (or plan to sync) all memory operations
  right before an instruction needs to be ISA-emulated; so I am just assuming
  that there will not be any pending requests in the cache/memory hierarchy
  when this invalidate is received. In other words, invalidation can start
  immediately and does not need to be blocked by anything. Also, it seems that
  the current cache can be invalidated on a per-line basis already via a
  soft-connection "funcp_invalidate" from mkFUNCP_Memory in
  memory/hybrid/hybrid-funcp-memory.bsv, and this invalidation is also not
  blocked on anything.

- Use a pseuty TTY for logging stdout/stderr in run.bmark.  This causes
  both the timing model and Bluesim to use line buffered output.

- Dynamic parameters now work in both hardware and software.  Parameters
  are derived from awb --dynamic params.  Software parameters are just like
  Asim.  Only integer parameters are supported in hardware.  At the beginning
  of a run the software side streams all dynamic parameters through a ring
  in the hardware.  Declare parameters in Bluespec with:

    `include "asim/provides/hasim_modellib.bsh"
    `include "asim/dict/PARAMS_<module>.bsh"
    ...
    Param#(<bits>) param <- mkDynamicParameter(`PARAMS_<module>_<param name>);

  Notes:
    - <bits> may be up to 64 bits
    - <module> and <param name> should be all capital letters
    - The Param interface has a _read method so you can get a parameter value
      just by using the object name.  There is intentionally no write method.

Get rid of the warnings about conflicting writes to the prfValids vector
by adding an execution_order pragma.  According to Bluespec this does not
affect the scheduler.  It only affects the priority encoder for outputs
of a cycle.  When the warning is printed the compiler picks a priority
anyway, so there is no problem using the pragma.  There is a longer
discussion at http://bluespec.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=281

Increased size of functional partition cacheline. Previously it was set
to be equal to the word-size. The `FUNCP_CACHLINE_BITS parameter
indicates the size of the unctional partition cacheline in bits. Since
this value must be known external to the cache as well, the parameter is
defined in hybrid-funcp-memory.awb.

With cachelines bigger than words, a store sent to the cache that misses
must be translated into a load to memory.

The valid bits of the cache were not explicitly initialized to zero; fixed.

Passes hello and memory_tests_aligned in bluesim.

- Scan out statistics from HW frequently enough to avoid overflow.  Sum them
  on the software side and emit at the end of a run.  Scan out happens while
  the simulation remains live.
- Change stats file format to a compromise between machine readable (CSV) and
  human readable.
- Add --cycles option to stop simulation after some number of cycles.  (Will
  stop after the first heartbeat is received > requested cycle.)

  common any more.  Thought about building a base class and deriving from
  it, but that was even more work.

Marked the cycle passage with A-ports as discussed with Nikhil. Basically the module looks like this:

  1(enq)    1(deq)
   --->     <---
      ------
        | | |
      ------
   <---
 0(notFull)

The numbers are the A-ports latency. Currently the 0 latency A-ports are not there, but they must be added if we want to have non-zero latency credits.

- Enable model ID detection in run.bmark to avoid reloading FPGA when it already
  has the right bitfile.  Just reset.
- hasim_model.bsv now holds reset signal for 128 cycles.  Probably overkill.
- Scoreboard didn't recover from reset properly due to test for live tokens
  reading uninitialized values without checking an "allocated" flag.
- Clean up functional direct mapped cache.

- Clean up some bugs keeping the models from compiling after Murali's BRAM
  check-in.

* Update the regstate manager to drain its pipelines before any invalidate or
  fast rewind.

* Slow rewinds are still unimplemented, but now cause an assertion failure. We
  think we know how to do slow rewinds.

* This now allows the 5-stage model to pass all Alpha bechmarks in simulation.

- Speed up compilation by taking the ring write out of the assertions predicate
  test.  Testing an assertion now conditionally writes a register.  Another rule
  copies the register to the assertions ring.  This appears to speed up
  compilation.

- hasim-configure now does an unlink() of a destination before writing a
  generated file.  This should avoid writing through a link and overwriting
  sources when a source file has the same name as an AWB interface.  It also
  should complain when such a name class exists and exit.  Untested.

- Add set-associative cache functional cache.  There are two dynamic parameters:
   ENABLE_FUNCP_MEM_CACHE:
     0: Cache disabled.  All requests bypass cache and go directly to memory.
     1: Cache enabled.

   FUNCP_MEM_CACHE_WRITE_BACK:
     0: Write back.  Stores flushed on victimization.
     1: Write through.  Stores write to memory directly and cache dirty bits
        are never set.

- Add done signal for flushing from cache to regstate manager to guarantee
  all dirty lines are flushed before hybrid instruction emulation begins.

- Print a warning when using --tr command line switch and TRACE is disabled.

- Clean up emulation control signals to the functional cache

- Add a functional TLB through which all loads and stores now pass.  Two
  versions are available:  one that maps directly from VA to PA.  Another
  is a hybrid version.  m5 now uses the hybrid version and all addresses
  going through RRR are physical.  Translation is currently private to the
  functional model, but we can change that.  A few notes:

  - The current implementation of the TLB is pretty poor.  Just 8 entries
    in LUTs and a one entry victim buffer.  It is big and has too many
    misses.  That's just a local policy, though.  Slowdown isn't typically
    huge and I'll fix it soon.
  - Using physical addresses will let us avoid invalidating the cache on
    emulated instructions.  That's next week's work.
  - For stores, a hit in the TLB takes no extra time in the functional
    model.  For fetches and loads there is a quick path that checks a small
    cache in LUTs for which there is no penalty.  There is a one stage
    bubble waiting for the full TLB before issuing the load in a longer path.

- split software stack into two threads: a Monitor/Service thread and a
  System thread. The Monitor/Service thread monitors the hw/sw channel
  and calls service methods if required. The System thread executes the
  software side's primary application. The two threads are spawned by
  the Controller. If the System thread terminates, the software process
  will exit.

  All "pure" Bluespec hybrid models now need to define a
  BLUESPEC_SYSTEM_CLASS as part of the System AWB module. This might not
  be a good idea since some simple systems (e.g. counter demo) used to be
  agnostic to whether they were being built into a hybrid or standalone
  model.

  HAsim systems currently get around this requirement by using a hack:
  all top-level Controllers define a base SYSTEM_CLASS which simply blocks
  on a pthread condition variable that never gets signaled, thereby
  preserving the existing behavior of HAsim models.

- added a pure Bluespec RRR test/benchmark model.

- Fix a couple of address alignment bugs in TLB quick path calls from regstate mgr.

- Register state manager no longer invalidates caches before ISA emulation.
  It is the emulator's responsibility to invalidate on write or just flush
  dirty lines on read during software-side emulation.  There is an RRR method
  for invalidating the whole cache for clueless software emulators.

  Note:  invalidate all as a sw -> hw service is not well tested since no ISA
  emulator currently uses it.

- Improve heartbeat info. printing.

  hashTo32() takes an arbitrary number of bits as input and yields a 32 bit
  hash.  It is safe to truncate the resulting hash to any size.

More careful separation of virtual and physical address sizes.  MEM_ADDRESS
is passed between HW and SW through RRR as 64 bits, independent of the size
of a physical address inside the FPGA.  This lets us choose physical address
sizes between 32 and 64 bits.

- Split TLB into separate ITLB and DTLB.
- Change TLB soft connection to the one upon which we agreed.  No takes a tuple
  of token and address.  Kept quickTranslateVA() method to avoid modifying
  regstate manager interface, but we'll drop the method after regstate manager
  changes.
- Rename option to turn off cache FUNCP_MEM_CACHE_ENABLE so it gets sorted
  with other cache options.
- Software-side statistics receiver now confirms that a statistic appears at
  most once in the hardware.

- Implement slow rewind.  Moved register freelist pointer from snapshot
  to regstate manager, since it is needed for fast snapshot-based rewinds
  and slow rewinds.
- Add a module that holds just interface classes for communication between
  timing models and the functional partition (interface/funcp-timing-interface.bsv).
  Instead of passing tuples we will start to pass structs so fields can be
  added without having to modify all timing models.
- Add mkRegFileInitialized() and mkRegFileFullInitialized.  Same interface
  as standard Bluespec types but initializes the RegFile before first use.
- Fix off-by-one error in command line parsing of quoted arguments that have
  escapes.  This was breaking mcf and any other benchmark with command line
  arguments.
