How to add or make your own documentation:
------------------------------------------

1. Edit your docbook in the xml subtree.  It is strongly recommended that you
   use an XML editor/validator such as xxe.  xxe is a Java application and is
   already installed in Hudson as part of the VSSAD environment.

2a. In this directory (docs/docbook), type "make" to convert the docbook
   xml to HTML via xsltproc.  

2b. Check for conversion and syntax  errors.

3. Examine the resulting html in the "html" subdirectory.
