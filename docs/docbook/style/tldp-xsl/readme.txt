The XSL style sheets in this package are used to create customized HMTL
and PDF output for The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP) authors using
DocBook-XML.  These style sheets do not replace the DocBook-XSL style
sheets, but rather work with DocBook-XSL to set certain parameters and
options to create customized output.

For information about installing and using the stylesheets, please refer
to the tldp-xsl-howto document included in the ./doc directory of this
package.
